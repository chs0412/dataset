After adding the extra detents, we discovered that the first detent in the original was right on mil power, which required more force to pull the throttle back.  This was not ideal for formation flying as you need constant fine controll of the throttle from IDLE through MIL.

So in this remix, I add a long groove through the entire travel range, and have 5 evenly spaced detents beyond the MIL stop for the AB stages in the Tomcat.  All other parts are the same as the original.",,"['dcs', 'detent', 'f-14b', 'throttle', 'x55']",2,373,1670,0,0,1,Gadgets,video-games,"I think it should, since the X56 is basically a re-skinned X55, afaik.  It's not a terribly long print job, though, so I'd just print it and see.  As for detents for SC, this doesn't have a center throttle axis detent, it only has the last detents where an afterburner's would be for sims like DCS.  I have included the F360 files though, so if you're so inclined you could easily do a remix of it for SC with the detents as required.  This is also a remix from BManx2000 original (located here: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2370066), and he has some videos on how to install it and whatnot, definitely check that one out as it might actually be easier to modify for SC, if you're so inclined.

As for your printer:  it seems like your bed is 120mm x 120mm, which means you'll have to put the base piece on an angle diagonally to fit it on your bed.  The dimensions of the main detent piece are 23.5mm x 184mm x 18mm.  Hope this helps, good luck!Would this work with the Logitech X56 Throttle?

Once you remove the small stick from the module base there is a smaller stick under it.  My button mod should slide (snuggly) over this stick.  (You may need to widen the hole to clear any printing residuals).  After that it's fitting the module back in place with the new button.

Reassembly is a bit tricky, but with some patience it's well doable. Thanks for sharing this design, Wizzer. I had exactly the same thought as you did, especially since I was used to having a button there from my Logitech Extreme 3D Pro and the sim I play having primary and secondary weapons (aside from missiles). The end result is not as clicky as a proper button, but it's a very good improvement over the analog mini-joystick on the thumb.

I wish the same could be done with the hat switch on the top-right corner of the joystick (main picture of this thingie), but that one cannot be pushed, so I may contact Logitech to see if they have an alternative."

I have released them for free but  **do feel free to make a donation if you like the end product :)**

## **What this is:**

 - Buttons and center logo replacement for the Thrustmaster T300 Ferrari GTE sim racing wheel.
- Both are quick prints, ~10-15mins
 - May work for other wheels too, do try and report back if you do :)
 
## **What to print:**
 - **For the buttons:**
	Each button is made up of 1 pin (""Button Pin_T300GTE.stl"") and 1 button (""Buttton_T300GTE.stl"")
	The pin is inserted into the bottom of the button, with the hex head going into the bottom hole of the button
 - **For the center logo:**
	2 versions are provided: 
1. McLaren logo (""LogoMcLaren_T300GTE.stl"")
2. Blank logo for customization (""LogoBlank_T300GTE.stl"")

## **Installation:**
For both the buttons and the logo, you will have to take apart the wheel itself. This is a simple process and the whole thing should take less than 10 minutes.
 - Buttons: Reuse the rubber part found under each  of the original steering wheels
 - Logo: Pop out the original Ferrari logo by releasing the clips and snap in the new one. Be careful as the clips may be fragile

Digital Eclipse's Mike Mika blended them into a paddle adapter for Xbox Series X and Series S controllers, intended to make the analog game controls in [Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration](https://atari.com/products/atari-50th-the-anniversary-celebration) more natural and comfortable. Try it on Pong, Warlords, and Neo Breakout, among others. 

This version is specifically designed to clip onto Xbox Series S and Series X wireless controllers (with the USB-C connector). However, the frame clips INTO the USB-C port, as shown on the red controller photo -- meaning this cannot be used if you need the controller to be wired. Wireless, no problem. An alternative is to print the [Xbox One version](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5602841) and cut away part of the frame's top bar with a hobby knife, as shown on the blue controller photo. 

You will need a standard 608 skate bearing (8x22x7). You can find these in multipacks for very affordable prices from [a variety of vendors on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=608+skate+bearing). 

This design works fine with PLA, but feel free to use the filament of your choice. For assembly instructions, see the [video](https://youtu.be/gIlz4Ty2hMc). 

Gamers, please feel free to remix this design for other systems and controllers. We encourage your improvements and would love to see this design improved by others.

This is a simple Logitech steering wheel quick disconnect adapter that I threw together; meant to be combined with one of the GT or F1 style aftermarket modifications rims that have been coming out lately.

So far, I've only made a single adapter for one of the MVHStudios rims, but I could probably bust out a couple more if the demand is there and specs are given. Honestly I'd be happy enough to see someone make something like it in scad form so that anyone would be able to make spec adjustments on the fly though.

The quick disconnect is built around the same dimensions as what AMStudio uses, so any of those mods should work with it.

Cons I can think of so far:
* Aesthetically not as attractive.
* Adds additional weight to the steering wheel.
* This might increase the amount of FFB loss form add-on wheels.
* The primary and secondary wheels will be installed at a different distances.
* Logitech buttons are fairly inaccessible during use of the secondary wheel.

Some pros:
* More hand clearance provided than what is given for the paddle shifters.
* Users are not committed to a single wheel configuration.
* No additional PCB or Arduino support required.
* Rally games don’t require much switchology.
* Console friendly.

ABS is probably a better option, but PLA seems to work. Although if PLA, I would suggest printing it at angle, somewhere between 15° to 45° to increase tensile strength of the shaft.

There is also a support piece underneath that you don't see in the photo that is needed for stability because it's not flat along the top of the bravo/alpha, and the holes are exactly where they need to be.

4757053,"Beat Saber Handle for Vive Tracker - ""Cotton Candy Cone""",https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/86/ef/3d/47/c8/large_display_cotton-candy-cone-with-pogo-buttons.jpg,2021-02-10,18,30,4,"# Cotton Candy Cone
## Lightweight Beat Saber Handle for Vive Tracker

The Cotton Candy Cone is a lightweight handle for using Vive Trackers as controllers in Beat Saber. The finger loops allow faster movement, more range of motion, and less hand and wrist strain than all grips on standard controllers.

The name ""Cotton Candy Cone"" is because it's light, and because my [username is cottoncandy](https://scoresaber.com/u/76561198025580167).

Controller | Weight | Notes
--- | --- | ---
Valve Index Knuckles | 194g |
Vive Tracker with one-hand camera grip (a common setup) | 163g | (Vive Tracker: 88g. The grip I bought: 75g)
Cotton Candy Cone | 123g | (Tracker: 88g. Bolt: 23g. Plastic as I printed it: 11g)

I made this handle because I wanted to be able to control the sabers with my fingers, instead of moving my wrist and entire hand, but the Index Controller and the Vive Trackers with a simple cylindrical camera grip both required so much grip strength to hold on to that I couldn't. The finger loops on the Cotton Candy Cone allow you to hold on to and control the sabers with only two fingers, increasing range of motion and allowing your hand to relax. This is most noticable on fast up and down sections, which I can do with my palm sideways without even moving my wrist, but is helpful in every direction. You don't even need a wrist strap since it's so secure, even when holding the controller loosely.

You will need 2 Vive Trackers obviously, and it comes with all the pros and cons of that (cost, battery life, slightly worse but adequate tracking quality). There are guides elsewhere on the internet for how to set up your Vive Trackers for use in Beat Saber. Note that you can connect additional buttons onto a vive tracker (see the POGO Pin Buttons section below), so if you're into that kind of project, the lack of buttons doesn't have to be a downside.

You will also need 4"" bolts to attach the handle to the tracker's ¼"" camera mount. I used [these partially threaded bolts from McMaster-Carr](https://www.mcmaster.com/91253A566/), but I've included `bolt-4inch.stl` if you want to try to print them.

Print the `cotton-candy-cone-handle.stl` and `cotton-candy-cone-spacer.stl` files.

## Printing

Print the handle on its side. I recommend using support for the stabilizing pin, but not inside the bolt hole. In Cura, ""Support Placement: Touching Buildplate"" works well. You'll have to cut/sand the support off the fillets on the bottom, but you should sand the finger holes anyway because your fingers will be spinning in there a lot and you want them to be as smooth as possible.

I personally printed with PETG because I like the feel of it more than PLA, and printed with only 3 walls, 4 top/bottom layers, and 10% infill because weight matters more than print quality or strength.

I also added some tape on top to give my thumb a little more grip.

The spacer can be printed flat with no support.

## POGO Pin Buttons

The Vive Tracker contains 6 ""POGO pins"" for connecting to accessories. I used these to wire up a trigger button and menu button, so I could navigate menus without reaching to the button on the front of the tracker. It's nice to have, but is not necessary.

You'll need buttons (I used [these](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07WF76VHT/) because they're small) and a bit of soldering. If you use buttons of the same dimensions as mine, they'll fit nicely into `cotton-candy-cone-pogo-adapter.stl`, which replaces the spacer. If you use a different size, you may need to change that design to fit your needs.

Sending a button press on the Vive Tracker is as simple as connecting the right pin to ground. Wire Ground (pin 2) to both buttons, Trigger (pin 4) to one button, and Menu (pin 6) to the other. I filled the pocket that makes contact with the POGO pin with solder to prevent the wire from slipping back out of the hole and to ensure a good connection, and then super glued the buttons and wires to the plastic.

To simplify things, you can skip the menu button (you can get the pause menu by hitting the system button on the Vive Tracker twice), or only wire buttons on one hand.

You can read more technical details about the Vive Tracker in the [Vive Tracker Developer Guidelines](https://developer.vive.com/documents/721/HTC-Vive-Tracker-2018-Developer-Guidelines_v1.5.pdf).

## Remixing

Please remix this concept, with attribution to this original post. I'd love to see what improvements people can come up with. Some changes I think would be good:

* Make it shorter. I chose 4"" bolts because I assumed I would need to fit the whole hand, but the index and middle fingers provide so much control on their own that the long tail of the handle just gets in the way, and it even limits range of motion a little bit. I think 3"" or 3¼"" bolts would probably be the right length, allowing the ring finger to still provide support and stabilization, allowing more range of motion in some directions, and cutting another 7 grams or so off the weight.
* Make different sizes. The finger holes are 20mm inner diameter so they can spin freely on my average-sized fingers, but there are a lot of different sizes and shapes of hands out there. Simply scaling the model won't work, so new sizes will require editing the CAD model.
* Add a vibrator. I experimented a little with adding a vibrator for the haptic feedback when cutting blocks, but decided that feature wasn't worth the effort. It might be worth it to you. I believe the vibration is powered and controlled by a 3 volt signal on pin 1, but you will need to do your own experimentation.
* Support the upcoming [Tundra Tracker](https://www.tundratracker.com). It looks like it will be much lighter than the Vive Tracker. It's still being designed, (It'll be released mid to late 2021. This is being written in Feb 2021.) but it will probably have a backwards compatible camera mount, like the Vive Tracker. But the real potential will be to remove the camera mount and heavy bolt, and screw directly into the tracker like another swappable base plate, cutting even more weight.

I've included the FreeCAD .FCStd file in case that makes it easier for you, but I'm new to CAD so I make no promises as to how usable it is.

Note that there are 2 tops provided, one asymmetric and a symmetric one. Pick one!

Micro SD to SD Card Extension Cable Adapter TF Flexible Extender SD Card Reader

They all look the same with the black box but they're are all the same pretty much. You can easily open the box as they are only snapped in.

____

Once again back to the drawing board to combine what I wanted into one product. This mount has a wide range of movement and can technically go full parallel to the surface it's mounted on.

**Here's what you'll need per mount:**

- For assembly **2x 4mm screws and bolts** 
- For mounting **1x 4mm wall screw** (optionally double faced adhesive and/or glue gun)

**What I ended up doing for my own mounting:** for my plaster wall, only one wall screw, no visor, no anchor ; for my concrete wall, anchor messed up, I ended putting glue around the screw, double adhesive on the back of the mount, put the thing in, then topped it off with the glue gun all around. Bit overkill, but I don't take risks.

_____


About the bracket, it was my solution for a very specific problem of mine as you can see in a picture, I've adapted it for regular corner, but to use it properly you'll need a glue gun.

_____


**All of my designs have roughly a 0.2 to 0.4 mm offset/compensation for things to fit** according to how my printer prints. I have no idea if this is a universal problem or not. This mount doesn't have much friction and didn't require any post process on my end. The screws needed a tiny push.

**Supports on my designs are always minimal if not nonexistent.** Here you should only need them for the base of the hinges, nothing else.",,"['articulated', 'corner', 'corner_bracket', 'mount', 'oculus', 'oculus_rift', 'sensor', 'sensor_mount', 'wall_mount']",6,394,505,0,0,0,Gadgets,video-games,

However, EA cartridges are a different shape, and while some EA games came with ""universal"" cases that could hold both cartridges manufactured by EA and Sega, many do not, and that can be frustrating if you're trying to source replacement cases from sports games.

I've designed this adapter piece to solve this problem. It attaches permanently to an EA case and turns it into a universal Genesis / Megadrive game case. Now all those EA sports game cases that were once useless for non-EA games can be used to hold whatever Genesis games you want.

Printing recommendations:
I used Hatchbox ABS with an enclosure and a bed heated to 110 degrees. I also used supports with no vertical separation layers. I used a 20mm brim and printed directly on glass using ABS juice to ensure there'd be no warping or shrinking. I highly recommend ABS since it is less brittle than PLA and will not warp if left somewhere warm like a hot attic.

To attach the clips to your EA sports cases:

1) Use sandpaper to roughen the surface of the case where the clips will be mounted, and roughen the backs of the clips (this will ensure a tight bond)
2) thoroughly clean the mounting surfaces with alcohol
3) Apply super glue or a strong 2-part liquid epoxy to the back of the clips on the roughened surface
4) place carefully on the case as pictured. Hold firm for about 30 seconds and then let cure. Several hours (overnight is preferable).

I have probably not seen every type of EA game case so you may need to cut the case a bit to make the clips fit properly, depending on what kind you have. As long as it ends up looking like the picture above you'll be good. I highly recommend dry fitting it with a Sega cartridge before you glue it into place.

Edited 2021-10-20 - Rev3 code that includes a ""curve"" variable to emulate load cell or support a soft stop.  See code comments for setup instructions.

IF YOU NEED A CHEAP Soft stop for resistance, check out my TPU ""Vibration Dampener Block"" project.  It's shown installed on the master cylinder shaft in one of the pictures here.  Just drill a hole to make it fit.

This is a very simple setup to add a Hall Sensor to the generic handbrakes being sold for cheap, for SimRacing use.

You need:

1) Generic handbrake like the one in the photos, available from the usual sources.  (~$23).

2) One Leonardo Pro Micro (~$5)

3) One Hall Effect Sensor - Honeywell SS49E (~$1)

4) One 10mm x 5mm circular neo magnet (~$1)

5) Prints of the two included STL files


Instructions:

1) Solder the Hall Sensor directly to the Leonardo as shown.  The sensor should stick up at a 90 degree angle from the circuit board.  The larger face of the sensor package should be oriented to face the magnet when assembled.

2) Snap the Leonardo into the printed bracket.  No glue is necessary if the print's tolerances are reasonably tight.  The little hole in the bracket should be directly lined up with the Leonardo's red LED.

3) Install the magnet into the other printed piece.  It's a tight fit and you may need to warm up the PLA with a heatgun or flame.  You can put a drop of superglue in there but I didn't.

4) On the brake, undo the two hex screws holding the thin aluminum cylinder crosspiece, and reinstall the crosspiece in the alternate holes to provide a hard stop to the brake lever (see photo - it's the slim black cylinder next to the magnet-holding bracket).

5) On the brake, liberate the master cylinder from the rest of the assembly by removing the four hex-head screws securing it to the brake's frame.  Then unscrew the shaft from the aluminum receiver on the sliding portion of the mechanism.  You can then slip the printed magnet bracket over the shaft as shown, and reassemble the master cylinder.

6) Install the bracket containing the Leonardo onto the brake assembly as shown.  It just snaps on and uses the two holes in the top of the aluminum brake frame to stay positioned.

7) Open up Arduino IDE and make sure you have the Joystick Library available: https://github.com/MHeironimus/ArduinoJoystickLibrary

8) Load the included code in the ZIP file onto the Leonardo.  It was revised on 2/5/2021 to include self-calibration at power-on, to account for variances in sensors and magnets.

9) Now you have a new single-axis joystick in Windows that you can map to a handbrake in your games.  If your output seems inverted, you can flip the magnet over and reinstall it in the bracket to reverse output.

Good Luck, and I'd love to see any builds!

**Update: Added files for left side so you don't have to remember to mirror some of the files.**

**Update 2: ""Headband Latch - Backplate w Bolt.stl"" - Combined back plate and bolt as requested in the comments!  It really should have been made like that from the beginning and was only not like that due to the iterative design process I used and my own lack of thorough thought!**

**Update 3:** Just noticed someone else already remixed and combined the bolt and back plate; however, I take offense (not really) to their statement that ""The original part separated into two parts is very fragile"".. I have used this same bolt in a number of projects and under extensive testing I have broken the bolt a number of times and *every time* it has broken it has *always* been due to layer separation from over-tightening, and it *always* happens in the middle of the bolt nowhere near the hex head end which is either combined or not... combining it just make life easier because the bolt doesn't loosen from the housing when you undo it, any added strength from combining it is unnecessary because that is not the failure point of the bolt - layer adhesion is. :P

You should **not** over-tighten the hinges, it is only necessary to tighten them enough that the teeth lock together!


##### Explanation:

The BoboVR M2 has a terrible design flaw that affects a lot of people, but it seems the yelling of how great it is has drowned out the cries for help from those for whom it just does not work.

The M2 uses a rubber grommet (rubber ring) to create tension in the hinge between the headband and back strap; unfortunately, that rubber grommet is just not wide enough to create the friction required to hold the strap in place if you tilt your head back or duck down.

I thought it only affected people with long straight hair based on most of the negative reviews and comments on Am*zon and Reddit; however, it seems based on comments to my post about this design that it's more than just that.
Although long hair doesn't help because the top layer of hair creates a low-friction surface against the layer of hair below making the headset slip more easily.

After making my own headset based on the M2 and two other headbands I've bought and been disappointed with (either too small or the same loose hinge that the M2 suffers from), I have realised that the back strap really needs to be offset lower for a nice fit because then it is pulling straight into the back of the head instead of diagonally up.

##### Instructions:

5 pieces to print, a Two pieces that slot together and hug the headband, one piece that sets the back-strap lower and locks it in place, and a nut and bolt.

I would advise to use a small touch of super glue to hold the `Hex Bolt` in place against the `Headband Latch Backplate` otherwise it might fall out of place slightly when you loosen the nut to adjust the strap, which is annoying, but not something to cry about if you don't have any glue.

Print at 0.2mm and in PLA is best because it's easier to remove the supports.

Only `Headband Latch.STL` requires supports on the build plate only. They can be finicky to remove if printing in PETG as they stick to easily to the teeth of the hirth joint.
Cura prints only a small ring of supports which is much easier to remove.",,"['bobovr', 'bobovr_m2', 'oculus_quest_2', 'quest_2']",10,170,159,1,0,3,Gadgets,video-games,"Yeah, that is something I didn't consider.. mainly because I've switched to using mirrored bolts and nuts for my headstrap so that both my hands are turning in the same direction when I adjust while wearing it.

If I mirror it for the other side, wouldn't it also mirror the bolt? Would I need to print another knurled nut, but also mirrored?Sorry, I haven't been online for a while.. I've just uploaded a combined part, but now I see that someone else has already remixed one. I recommend using my model because whatever program they used messed up the mesh on the screw thread, so mine has a cleaner thread and I also added a small chamfer where the plate and bolt connect.I did already print it, but I just broke one side, so if you're down to combine them, I'd be glad to print it againActually, if you haven't printed it yet, let me know, and I'll combine them properly and upload the file.. I shouldn't be so lazyYeah probably, but I made this using the nut and bolt files from another Quest headstrap, so I didn't think to do that at the time... feel free to combine it yourself - should be easy to do in Meshmixer or Tinkercad, but I won't update this anymore because I have finished designing my own headstrap that is better than the M2, and for the headband hinge in that, I did indeed combine the back strap and bolt together.Wouldn't it make sense to combine the bolt and the backplate into one solid piece so it doesn't need to be glued in?For anyone that needs help taking the M2 apart, here is a link to a youtube video (it's in German, but has English subtitles and you just need to watch what he does): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jtt4lFi_EI@smiley_mcfrown  I like your design! but could you tell me how to seperate BoboVR M2's headband and back-strap,I tried and failed.

Basically you take out the screw at the hinge and then use a small screw driver (Or some other rod) to push the white cap off by pushing on it through the screw hole. After that you separate the straps (They show it by twisting along the axis (Not the axis the hinge is on(aka, if the strap moved along the x axis then you would twist in the y/z axis)). Now they are apart. I would recommend watching the video they have on the product page first though."

I wasn't happy with the stability of my original design, so I made this one much sturdier.  The main Platter with the left and right inserts installed require you to pull the Kishi out as far as you can muster, but it does fit.  The entire design is meant to be screwed in place and the brackets can be set depending on whether you want to use it in portrait or landscape mode.

Note:  I don't remember what size screws it's built for.  I honestly just made it for what I had available at the moment!  Also, this is a ""destructive"" mod in that you'll have to cut the rubber cushions at their tops in order for the Z Fold2/3 to slide into place.

CheersHey, I think this might be too tight of a stretch. I broke my kishi trying to put it on the 3d printed attachment. It stretched too far, and now only the right side of the controller works. i did the same thing.  I got these from ebay and it fixed the problem tho it looks ugly.

https://www.ebay.com/itm/153526453144I almost went through a similar situation.
But I thought. Why are the parts divided?
And here's the conclusion:
Mounting while assembling rather than installing after assembly.
That is, tighten the bolts while installing.

A point to be aware of is that when dismounting the mount, remove the bolt and then release it.
Otherwise, the controller may be damaged. "

It (like the arcs before it) was designed and made for a fellow vectrex owner whose controller had bit the dust when the mounting ears on the joystick bracket snapped and the joystick basically fell into the controller shell.

It's not a moving part so it's not much to say about it other than it probably should be printed with both raft and supports enabled to get somewhat perpendicular angles and planar mounting surface for the joystick module in the end. It was modelled after an original unbroken joystick bracket. The hole pattern for the mounting holes are off, I know. But the original also was spaced that way. I think it's a fail safe for irregularities in the controller shells. If the screw posts it is supposed to mount on are not straight, this slightly off center hole pattern may compensate for that. Anyway, the off center hole pattern IS intentional from my side. It fitted my controller and it fitted the controller that was repaired with it when I made it. So I hope it will fit your controller too.

As I have a handbrake already attached to my 8020/Aluminium extrusion based rig, I needed an adapter so I could run the sequential shifter alongside it to get it into a comfortable position.

Therefore I designed this strong adapter which has 5 bolt down points (utilising M8 bolts in my design) along with the associated T nuts, with 3 fixing points on the top and 2 on the bottom/side.  The Sequential shifter is then bolted down to the rig adapter using the holes already provided, with nuts on the underside.

It securely clips on to the headset quickly & easily.
It can also be removed quickly if/when required.
Screw to fit the vive tracker on the mount, is included.

The reason for this is to give a convenient place to securely fit a tracker if trying to change the hmd to use lighthouse tracking instead of wmr tracking.
Being able to convert it to lighthouse tracking is something wanted by many sim rig users who would like this ability so they could easily enable motion compensation of the sim rig movement
also it is something wanted by people with poor environments for the wmr camera tracking.

The bracket itself weighs approximately 14 - 15 grams so the only real weight is in the tracker itself.
This seems fine to me from how it feels, but some people may want to add a counterweight if they don't like the extra weight on the front

I have not actually had headset tracking with the vive tracker working yet myself.
I just created the design now in the hope for a possible update to OpenVR-SpaceCalibrator or possibly another piece of software which will help enable this feature.

If anyone has any good confirmed instructions to get this working, I would be very interested so please comment

Set the tracker override to camera in steamVR config file.  Install input emulator and apply the latest DLL fix.  When you open steamVR your camera would be facing up since thats the direction the tracker is facing.  Once you have configured offsets that work you can write a batch file and have your tracking offsets in there so its easy to apply, the batch file would be in radians instead of degrees.

This is the mounting bracket for the Saitek/Logitech flight panels.
This allows you to replace a broken original or complete your simulator cockpit with your own builds.

To adapt to all 3D printers, I cut the support in two parts. To hold them together, you will need 2 x 8mm M3 bolts and 2 x M3 nuts. You can, if you want, use glue between the two parts (but it is not necessary).

If, after printing, you notice a retraction of the two parts and a lack of 1 to 2 mm, I have also provided 2 ""shims"",top and bottom, which will prevent you from reprinting everything (this does not impact the holes for the screws ). You can easily resize them to your needs.

I also include the bracket in one part for those who have a larger printer!

So, you're gaming with your Playstation 4 VR. You are plastered to your favorite gaming chair and have all of your gaming necessities set - VR headset, headphones, drinks and snacks ... then you realize that someone has moved your PS4 tracking camera (or maybe the cat did it ???).  Don't get up!  Grab the remote to position the cam across the room!

I made this out of necessity. As a paraplegic it is a chore to get up just to re-position the camera. Or perhaps your bros are over and when taking turns the cam needs to be moved.

I've included the .stl files for the camera mount, the base, which houses the servo and electronics, and the bottom cover. The arduino sketch is also provided, however depending on the remote being used you may need to edit the remote codes in the sketch ... which are converted to DECIMAL values.

THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS. I'm building mine now and will upload a video when finished. Below is are links to the servo and IR remote as well as the recommended arduino pro mini and FTDI programmer.

After loading the provided sketch: Connections - I used a panel mount DC input jack with a 9-12V supply. Connect power to the micro's GND and VCC pins. Also connect power to the servo and IR receiver. Pin 11 is communication for the servo while pin 9 is for the IR remote. 

CHECK THE REMOTE DECIMAL CODE VALUES!!! They may differ from my remote. The sketch provided will display all received codes via the serial monitor @ 9600 baud.

This one in particular is from a Simpsons arcade game, which I noticed was missing while I was rebuilding other parts of the joystick.  I'm not aware of anyone that sells this part by itself, so I decided to design/print one.  

The purpose of it is to give the switch actuator (round plastic part that gets pushed into the switches) an even surface to press the leaf switch.  The switch itself has the contact riveted through the metal, so without this, there will be an extra bump, which would eventually damage the switch actuator, and possibly cause poor control.  

According to the diagram, this is Wico Part Number 99-080033, or similar (looks slightly different than the one from the diagram).  I believe that diagram is from an older model Wico Leaf Switch, so the part number may have changed... but it has the same/similar functionality.","Print in your choice of plastic (I used ABS, since arcade games sometimes get pretty hot... especially during transport/storage).  I believe the original plastic was nylon, which proabably has better wear resistance, but in a home environment, ABS should hold up just fine.  

The part is very thin (0.025"" at the thinnest part), so I'd recommend a thin layer height.  I printed at 0.25mm layer height, and the thinnest part was 3 layers thick.  

Once printed, simply press into the two holes on the leaf switch, on the side of the leaf switch without the extra metal reinforcement.  Depending on your printer, you may need to use a knife to trim excess plastic from the pegs.  Mine made a slight mess around the pegs, since it was printing plastic on top of the still molten previous layer (only took a few seconds to print those layers).","['99-080033', 'arcade', 'guard_actuator', 'joystick', 'leaf_switch', 'wico']",2,651,2156,0,0,1,Gadgets,video-games,"Cool...

I originally printed the design as-is, but found that 2mm craft foam (the thickness you can buy in a craft store in single sheets) was causing the case to be unable to close when I put foam on both the bottom and top. It added too much height for the case to shut. I imagine the case would work fine with 1mm foam, but I couldn't find any way to get 1mm thickness without buying way more than I needed. 

Instead, I modified the design to accommodate 2mm craft foam:

The bottom half now has an insert that is 220x50mm and is 1.2mm deep (so that there is 0.8mm of foam protruding once you glue it in). Likewise, the top has had its raised area lowered by 1.2mm.

UPDATE Nov 30 2018: I added an STL for a version of the clasps that's something like 1mm longer. I found that the originals could sometimes be very hard to set and release, so marginally extending them allows it to still latch securely but not require so much force to release. Both versions are included in the files for convenience.

---

Supplies needed:

2x 20mm long M3 screws for the hinges
Super glue for gluing the foam to the case
2mm craft foam (I buy it at [Michael's stores](https://www.michaels.com/foamies-9-x-12-sheet-black/D059860S.html) in the US)

I recommend cutting the bottom foam a little smaller than the insert so that it fits easily, I did 218x48mm. 

For the top, I cut it a little larger so it had overhang over the plastic edge - 162x92mm

---

I only modified the version of the model that has the top and bottom as single pieces, because that's what I was printing on my CR-10.

The reason for this plate is that there are 2 bumps which will prevent you from using a flat VESA mount.  All you have to do is print this plate and put it in between your Asus display and your VESA mount plate and it will be rock solid.  Make sure your screws are long enough.  FYI, the screws used by Asus for the VESA mount are metric M4 screws.  I found that 20mm long ones would fit perfectly for me with this plate.

Description:
Super Smash Bros. Ultimate[b] is a 2018 crossover fighting game developed by Bandai Namco Studios and Sora Ltd., and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Switch. It is the fifth installment in the Super Smash Bros. series, succeeding Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U. The game follows the series' traditional style of gameplay: controlling one of various characters, players must use differing attacks to weaken their opponents and knock them out of an arena. It features a wide variety of game modes, including a campaign for single-player and multiplayer versus modes. Ultimate includes every playable character from previous Super Smash Bros. games—ranging from Nintendo's mascots to characters from third-party franchises—and several newcomers, having a total of over 70.",,[],2,353,1095,2,0,1,Gadgets,video-games,"forgot the word ""ultimate""

Came out perfect!

Used supports on hook part with orientation being on the back. The Go-tcha snaps right in snugly and comes out with a little force and bending at the hook.

Great model. Thank you!I made this with a fairly stiff TPU, and it was very difficult to get the Gotcha out without breaking it, even at 102% print size.  I ended up cutting off the back and it's more of a loop around the side/protecting the face now.  This made it much slimmer but the notch still holds the Gotcha very well.  If I printed from fresh, I would print on its back and adjust he height down until the loop was flat on the print bed."

Some collector edition games come in or with accessory steel cases that often lack a quality Switch Game Card holder, as was disappointingly the case with Bloodstained.  The Included ""holder"" was an afterthought and has no positive locking for the game or even for the holder to remain inside the case.

This is a stupidly simple design using the disc portion of these combo steel cases to positively hold a Switch Game Card.

Print it at any infill you like - the ""disc"" will be solid and it shouldn't require much of anything for the card holder portion.  I used 20% infill but I doubt it's important.

As you can see I was too excited to fit it in the case and removed it from the print bed while hot - warping it somewhat.  If you print one, allow it to cool first and you should have a mar-free disc surface.",,[],2,255,391,0,0,1,Gadgets,video-games,"Easily doable - could probably cram up to 6 around the face of it if you really tried.

No reason this can't be modified to fit more cards, though.  Maybe I'll see how many I can fit.

EDIT - 6 is probably the limit.  I've attached a 6-card version.pretty neat, though i personally would have had several card slots."

Also lines the LED's up to shine straight into each port perfectly! I've been asked about this multiple times by modders and DIYers but have been tweaking the design slowly and now feel its ready for the masses! 

This does still require you to cut out the back of the controller ports so I would say this is ""Moderate"" as far as ease of installation. 

Provided pics that should make it fairly obvious how to install. I was wanting to shoot a quick video but just don't have the time. Couple things to note....

You do this at your own risk!!!

1.) BE CAREFUL cutting the backs of the ports out! There is great potential of harming yourself or others or little animals that may be scurrying across your workbench at the time so be warned! I personally de-desolder the ports as it makes cutting out the backs a breeze for me plus gives me a good opportunity to get the ports really clean with some DeoxIT and also forces me to resolder all controller connections which is also a bonus!

2.) This WILL fit with the stock fuse in place but you may have to bend it out of the way. Usually I bend it forward towards the controller ports or just move it to the bottom of the board. 

3.) When your cutting the LED strip try and leave you the whole pad as it will just give you more surface area to solder to doing this will waste 1-2 LED's out of your strip but meh..

4.) I designed the wings that are sticking up in the backs on both sides for you to be able to bend the LED strip back and use some super glue to hold the LEDs back to make soldering easier. This is optional but recommended. 

5.) Squeezing the LED strip into the holder takes practice and can somtimes be a bit@#$! Just work one at a time from one side to the other and you will get it. I BELIEVE IN YOU!


Here are the links to the LED's I've designed these for, if you find a better source for the LED's with this spacing please let us all know so I can add it to this summary.

Just print each eye, glue together, then attach to a red hat to complete your cosplay!

Each layer is .02mm thick.  Designed so that you can print on smaller printers as separate layers of each color.  
Just print each file twice and stack, flipping along the flat edge of layer 1 or print the alternate single piece layer 1.  End of file name says what color filament to use (whi=white, bla=black, red=red)
Since the pieces are separate you can glue them together however you like: straight on, looking to the side, or googly eyes!  If you only have 1 color filament, print and paint :)

I'm very excited for Odyssey on the Nintendo Switch!  I prototyped this in 3D Builder.  Then I used TinkerCAD to split each side into halves.

All 3D printed pieces were designed and printed in the same day and the whole machine was also assembled during that same day. At around 10:30PM I was playing games on it.

If you want to build one for youself, what you'll need is:
- 1x MicroUsbBracket.stl
- 1x USBPortsBracket.stl
- 2x PiZeroBracket.stl
- 1x Raspberry Pi Zero W
- 1x Raspberry Pi Copper heatsink (the copper ones have a lower profile)
- 1x Micro SD card (at least 8GB)
- [RetroPie Image for Raspberry Pi Zero](https://retropie.org.uk/download/)
- 4x M2 Threaded brass metal inserts (Can be salvaged from old laptops)
- 4x M2 Screws, at least 5mm  long and at most 7mm long. (can be found with the brass inserts)
- 1x Mini-HDMI to HDMI cable adapter. 1 foot long or shorter, the shorter the better.
- 2x Small cable tie
- 4x USB type A ports
- 1x USB micro port. (also include some heatshrink that fits around it. The bracket for the USB micro port was designed for a very tight fit when heatshrink is used)
- 1x [4-port NanoHub](https://www.tindie.com/products/mux/4-port-nanohub-tiny-usb-hub-for-hacking-projects/)
- 1x SNES cartridge of your choice (can be found on ebay for varying prices)
- (if damaged SNES catridge) SNES replacement game stickers
- A bunch of 22AWG wires of different colors (red, black, green and white for standard usb colors)
- Solder and soldering iron
- Utility knife or rotary tool (for modding the cartridge)
- (not requiered but useful) Solder sucker
- A LOT OF PATIENCE. This project requieres to solder extremely tiny solder holes/pads, so take your time and never go faster than you think you can.

#### Notes:
HDMI adapter might need to be trimmed down to flatten it so it can fit in the cartridge.

Catridge needs to be moddified at many places inside:
- Cut away the middle support.
- Cut all walls in the connector opening.
- Remove the corner supports
- Might need to remove the extra supports on the tabs of the top cover, you'll see if you can't close it.

All 3D printed pieces are held in place using super glue. The USB ports are reinforced from the inside with hot glue and the HDMI female end of the adapter is glued to the catridge using super glue after flattening its surface.

Threaded brass inserts are inserted in the brackets by placing them on top of the holes in the brackets and then pushing into them with a soldering iron that is turned on. After the brass heats up (takes about 5 seconds) it will start sinking inside the PLA piece very easily. Simply push them down until they are flat with the top of the pieces or push them down a bit lower, since the brackets were designed so that longer screws can be used.

Solder 2 cables to the Micro USB port, one for 5V+ and one for GND, then add the heatshrink around it and heat it up. Once assembled, simply pass the wires through the hole of the bracket and push the port inside until it's flat with the wall. Make sure you insert it in the correct orientation, because it's almost impossible to get the port out of the hole without damaging it once it's fully inserted.

You will probably need to a pair of small tweezers to take the micro sd card in and out of the pi zero. Don't force it, it can break and ruin your whole raspberry pi board.

#### Extra Notes: 
I purposely do not talk about how you should wire the USB hub or the USB ports and which pads you should solder to on the raspberry pi zero because I believe that this kind of project should only be done by people who understand how these things work and how to solder properly (even if my soldering isn't that good). All missing information to build this project is easy to find with some quick research on Google, so if you're not able to find the information I purposely didn't mention here on your own, then maybe this project is too advanced for you. I'm open to helping others build this if they ask it in the comments, but this is a learning experience and you should go through it all if you want to understand how all of these things work.",,"['emulation', 'emulator', 'raspberry_pi', 'raspberry_pi_zero', 'snes', 'usb_hub']",3,425,1248,0,0,0,Gadgets,video-games,

Perfect fit for vive wands. Works well for most rifles in Onward, except for the P90 which is pretty much unusable. 
The main drawback is bullpup weapons can be awkward to reload - I sometimes grab the grenade when trying to pull out the magazine as it is close to my chest.

EDIT: update to v3.3 Added a longer stock option which puts trigger-to-shoulder distance at 335 mm (close to an AK5C). This also results in the sights being 80 mm farther away than with the short stock - too bad that isn't adjustable in Onward. While it may be more realistic and line up better with the in game model, it feels less ergonomic than the short stock imo.

Edit: updated to 3.3.7. Made the tail section easier to print and also moved the butt a bit lower so it works better with the AUG and TAR21, with no negative impact on the other weapons.
Edit 3.3.7.1: beefed up the strap attachment holes just in case.

I am just testing a new version with a different grip - I went even further and angled it back 5°. Also adjusted the heights to compensate for the alignment change.Printed my remixed version in PETG and after a fair amount of trial and error I'm finally happy with the result.  I extruded a [6.6mm diameter hollow cylinder](https://i.imgur.com/9ZejJbw.png) through the 'barrel' of the rifle stock and inserted about a 6"" length of 1/4"" diameter wooden dowel where FrontTube and MidTube fit together.  6.25mm == 1/4"", but if I printed it at anything less than 6.6mm I would experience layer separation when I jammed the dowel in the hole.  It seems to be very, very strong.

[The cylinder is from front to back](https://i.imgur.com/u564Lqb.png) which actually seemed to make it stronger (contrary to what I would have thought).  After some more research I learned -- which maybe is obvious to others, but wasn't to me -- that infill density doesn't have much to do with the strength of a part, but perimeters/wall thickness is the biggest factor when it comes to strength.  Adding the hollow tube through the middle of the barrel made it so there are twice the amount of 'perimeters' lengthwise on the part with [half being on the outside and half being towards the middle](https://i.imgur.com/qToCr4k.jpg).

[Here's a link](https://reprapltd.com/fibre/) to an article talking about a similar process, which I found after the fact but makes total sense to me.

I also angled the back cup about 3° backwards which may have actually been a bit too much, though it doesn't seem to cause any problems for me in Onward.  Smoothed out the ridges near the top of the grips as well.

Remixed files are attached.  Printed in Amazon Basics Black PETG on Prusa i3 MK3 (230°C / 85°C), 0.2mm layer height, 3 perimeters, 4 bottom layers, 5 top layers, 20% rectilinear infill.  I used Slic3r to generate custom supports only for the overhang on the front of the MidTube, everything else should print without support (can do support on build plate only if it's easier).  Thanks for the helpful input! 
For the fit, I did use a piece of electrical tape for awhile to make is snugger, but found I preferred to have the stock easily slide off by gravity when I wanted to drop the rifle.
Angling the back hand a bit more is something I have considered as well. I think that would improve the comfort too.    
Yes, I agree about the lips - I sanded mine down to be smoother, but they could use a redesign. I think the back one especially would be better if it stuck out further so the edge was not in the middle of your finger. 

I also had a bit of play at the centre barrel joint in my print, as the ends were not quite flush (maybe too much heat printing the bottom layers). I used super glue in the hole, but used original (expanding) Gorilla glue to fill the crack where the faces meet. It feels solid and has not been a problem so far. I'd like to see how the dowel works out though.
CheersFirst off, my print settings:
* Prusa i3 MK3
* Amazon Basics Black PETG (230°C nozzle, 85°C bed)
* 20% infill, custom supports
* 0.20mm layer height, 3 outer perimeters, 4 bottom and 5 top solid layers

 

I really like this Vive gun stock for Onward and Contractors.  A few notes, if I may:
* A thin strip of [adhesive felt](https://smile.amazon.com/Pllieay-Adhesive-Polyester-Furniture-Surfaces/dp/B07CPN1WRS/) inside the cups causes a fairly snug fit without the Vive wands being difficult to insert or remove.
* For my Prusa i3 MK3 I used Slic3r Prusa Edition to customize supports for the attachment studs and the lip of the cups, everything else printed perfectly without supports (aside from the RailToButt.stl which required basically full support in order for the attachment stud to print parallel to the build plate).  
* When using the SA 80 LMG in Onward, the alignment of the gun is such that sometimes the front hand fails to grab the vertical foregrip attachment.  If the rear hand were angled back just slightly this wouldn't be an issue.  Very few other guns seem to have a problem.
* I dislike how sharp the lips on the cups are.  I'm going to file them back and hope that works.  I also hope that I can figure out how to round the lip out in Meshmixer and re-print.
* I'm currently printing a slightly remixed version that uses a [1/4"" diameter wooden dowel](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Round-Dowels-Assorted-Styles-8ct/19613459) (3"" length used, I bought a single 36"" long dowel from Walmart for $0.57) between the MidTube.stl and FrontTube.stl to reinforce the method of attachment.  Whether it is due to the tolerances of my printer or the design I am not entirely happy with how the 'barrel' attaches between the two wand cups.  I have a fairly snug fit and I used some super glue but there's just a bit of play still and I'm concerned with extended use that it will break at that joint.  I will report back if I feel the improvement warrants it.

 

Even taking the small imperfections (regardless of the cause being design, print quality, or my own ineptitude) into account, this is by far the best of the three gun stocks I have printed and tried.  Thank you very much for sharing your design with the community!"

Also prefer to print without supports where possible as less waste and clean-up time.  This is a very simple edit - chopping off the battery compartment, reducing the screw sockets in depth and adding slopes to the sockets to allow for printing with zero support.

A good first layer adhesion is essential as this is a tall object with a small footprint so it can work loose.  [tip: if you print on painters tape or other disposable medium - having a bottle of superglue and accelerator spray handy to squirt around the base will allow you to save a print rather than see it fail at 90%!!).

Printed at standard 0.2mm and 25% infill easily strong enough if your layer adhesion is good.  Needed very little clean up afterwards other than a light edge scraping.

Original strap clips printed from Kreanym's design attached as suggested with a few spare HD drive mount type screws after a quick drill to clean the holes.

Glued packing foam to the inside and trimmed for additional comfort. [If using a solvent-based glue do test first to ensure it isn't going to react/melt your foam or print].

Its very comfortable - all credit to the original designer.

Goal is to make it easy to switch the quadrant to match controls of different types of planes, e.g. a modern single engine turboprop (example provided) to a twin engine, to a tubeliner (exercise for the reader) or anything else.  This replaces the original levers, but no other parts; fit should be identical.

The levers are modified to have a male side-release connector (common buckle in outdoor gear), but are otherwise identical (gearing and mounting point) to the original lever; they should be drop-in replacements.  The ""buckle"" parts are included to help further remixing, and an example set of levers, based loosely on a modern turboprop (Quest Kodiak), are provided.  Of course, a set of 4 or more straight levers could be used to model a twin, or a jet, etc.

[EDIT -- this does not work well, don't use as provided]: Minor additional modification is a simple tension-release mechanism to enable typical aircraft jog gates in a separate console housing, e.g. for beta throttle or condition lever and the like, without unduly stressing the lever pivot point.

[9/16/2020] - Initial release.

[9/17/2020] - Added NegativeSpaceTemplate.stl: Don't print this, but use it as the ""hole"" in a new extension, to receive the male end of the lever.  The example connectors are a good deal thicker than necessary, around 7.5 mm.  The receiving socket is about 12.3 x 4.3 mm, and has a solid core past the side levers, so it can be printed at 6 or even 5.5 mm thick for a cleaner look.  The lever itself is 15.05 mm wide, if you want to match that profile.

[10/24/2020] - Posted WIP prototype; the top level delaminated and needs a redesign.  The idea is that the levers and the entire ""skin"" (lever tracks plus pretty top layer) can all be quickly detached and replaced to simulate different planes.  So am I crazy like a fox or just crazy?

I'm not going for super-realism (tho I appreciate the people who do), but rather a quick-change to approximate the ""feel"" of different planes.  Note the mashup of switches -- they're the ones I want accessible during take-off/landing, not anything like any real plane.  Next version I may try to add the switch plate to the removable skin as well.

The published lever strain gauge DOES NOT WORK -- it fails/breaks on any twisting motion.  Best solution I've found is highly printer, slicer and material dependent.  Basically make the bottom layers roughly .75 to 1 mm thick (depends on material) before allowing any fill, then remove a 1-2 mm slice from the rest of the lever (no more ""W"" shape, just a square trench across the lever).  For the bottom layers, use an even multiple of layers depending on your optimal Z-stepper increment: E.g., Ender 3 likes .04 mm Z steps, so do something like 6 x 0.12mm bottom layers for .72mm total (or initial .20 + 5 x .12).  Do a couple of tests of different bottom thicknesses to get the right stiffness for whatever knob sits on top.  My big black handle will wobble too much at less than .84 mm, but all the others are fine at .6 mm.",,"['flight_simulator', 'gaming', 'lever', 'throttle', 'throttle_lever', 'throttle_quadrant']",8,338,71,0,0,1,Gadgets,video-games,"Thanks for the comment, and yes, that is exactly the idea.  See my note (under Discussion) on the failed strain gauge and replacement.

Posted a pic of my pseudo-Kodiak WIP.  X-Plane also allows profiles, and even dynamic remapping of all the levers and buttons, so that the Arduino code is blissfully ignorant of any actual flight sim details.

Cheaper, yes, maybe.  I'm probably 200 hrs into this, but that includes the learning curves for nearly every part of the project.  I think/hope that turning out a new ""skin"" and levers will take no more than a few days after I get the base design down.

Good luck to you.Still very early in my build of these, but I'm planning to use the FS2020 ""profile"" feature to switch between different throttle quadrant configurations. Basically, it can be set up with different control layouts and then toggle between them with a couple of clicks. And using these, the actual control levers can match the control layout (throttles, props, mixture, etc.). Very cool idea, and *far* cheaper than third party game controls. "

Is there a way I could possibly fix this?It looks great but I have some comments to leave about it. Some of the buttons don't fit in the holes correctly, I'll list them the x,a,y,b, buttons, down and right on the d-pad, the button with the 2 squares along with the button with the three lines and the last button the home button. Also as a design recommendation for Mitty it's hard to tell that's what it is so my advice is making it indented in just like Nanachi. Other than that it's really nice and thanks for making it.That's ok I understand Irish_Potato,

In terms of the fit, that can be a result of printing settings, type of printing, calibration, etc... you have to be very particular about how you support items and how you clean of supports. The base controller I used is utilized in all my designs, and others have found success in fitting the faceplate along with myself with this design. So it is unfortunate about the fit. If you send me your gcode file, or how you supported it, I may be able to help in respect with the fit.

As for the design, some of the Mitty features when indented wouldn’t appear properly since the smallest nozzle size for an FDM printer wouldn’t capture the indentations. That is the reason it is raised.

Let me know if you have any questions!

(https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4800379 under the CC BY 4.0 lisence) That mount has been fused with the open source Index Frunk model. There is also a hole next to the mount so you can pass the USB C cable through the frunk and right into the USB port of the headset. It is still quite jerry rigged, it's not elegant, but works quite well. Figured I'd share my STL for other Index users to try it out. Might find time later to tweak the mount's placement (college is taking all of my time lately)

You will need to get yourself and/or print:
- 1x Valve Index Frunk mount (the main item in this thing)
- 1x Slider (also included here) 
- 3x Mount extensions from the original thing (also included here)
- 2x M3 nuts
- 1x M3 screws
- some tape
- 4 3x3mm or 3x2mm round magnets to insert in the 3D printed frunk (to make it more sturdy if needed, but not required if using good tape)
- 1x USB C female to USB A male adapter

Here are the steps to mount this adapter:
1. Unscrew the original mount from the Vive Facial Tracker.
2. Screw the 3 mount extensions to the Tracker using the original scew and 1 M3 nut (be sure you tighten it enough so it doesn't move around while playing, but not too hard to not break it!)
3. Using a screw and a second nut, screw down the other side of the mount extensions onto the slider. (be sure you also tighten this enough so it doesn't move around while playing, but not too hard to not break it!)
4. Slide the slider with the tracker attached to it in the mount on the 3D printed frunk, then use some more tape (or anything else) to hold it down in case it wants to slide around.
5. Remove the original frunk of your Index (it is just held down by magnets.)
6. Pass the USB cable of the Tracker through the hole directly on the left of the mount, then using the USB C to USB A adapter, plug the Tracker's USB cable in the USB port at the front of the Index headset.
8. place your 3D printed frunk with the mount in its place. Be sure to use some tape to make it hold down better when playing (or anything else you can find to hold it down, tape works for me.)

From there, you should have a working Vive Facial Tracker after you install the required HTC runtime on your PC. You can adjust it forward and back and also tilt it to properly adjust the positioning (the original thing from TheMysticle works quite well,) then screw it down to lock it in place better (not to the point of breaking it though.)",,"['face_tracker', 'facial_tracker', 'frunk', 'htc_vive', 'htc_vive_pro', 'valve_index', 'valve_index_visor', 'virtual_reality', 'vr_headset']",3,279,526,1,0,2,Gadgets,video-games,FrunkTry using an M4 18mm screw instead of an M3.

While it works well for the Oculus systems with the Index It is not as easy as I would prefer to hold the front of the weapon in game with this accessory.   

I am in process of making a new solution specific for the index and should that pass muster I will post it for use by anyone else.   Still printing the final piece as I add this note.   In the meantime, happy printing and gaming.

<B>Updated 24 FEB 2020</B>

So this is ONLY contains the following parts to use the Valve Index with the excellent NoobTube gun stock that Toposolitario created:
* Right controller grip and clamp
      * Grip (v2.0) allows Index with handle booster to fit 
      * Grip (v.2.1) tighter for non-booster Index controller 
      * Clamp (v2.1) fits either grip
* Sling Ring clamp (NEW addition for convenience to Valve Index owners)

I edited BManx2000's grip for both versions.   You may wish to play with percentages if you want a looser/tighter fit.    Would suggest tighter by 1-3% on v2.0 and maybe looser by 1-2% on v2.1 if the default print doesn't suit your tastes.   I also modified Toposolitario's clamp to accommodate BManx2000's mixed grip.

I did create a v2 which the boosters will fit into and depending on your printer you may wish to decrease the size by a percent or two as there is a bit of play when I printed the v2 grip.   V2.1 will also fit with the booster, but it is a TIGHT fit, not something you would pull the controller out mid game and pop back in, but if you want a secure connection, it will definitely hold it.  :)I am attempting to print the boosters now with TPU  (new filament for me) and once that is done I will be able to confirm for sure, yet bet a modification will need to be made to the gun grip to support it.   If true I will update it and host that version as well.  

Fingers crossed I can get TPU figured out, else I will cave and print the boosters in PLA

I recommend the 6 inch pipes (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07SSWYCGL?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2_dt_b_product_details) rather than the 8 inch pipes for this design. 

All joints have teeth that allow 7.5 degree angle adjustments. Each joint is put together with a M4 x 30 bolt and two M4 hex nuts (one wound on the bolt all the way through and one hammered into the knob.) A total of 7 M4 screws and and 14 M4 hex nuts are needed. Because of the teeth for angle adjustments you DO NOT need to over tighten, hand tight is sturdy enough. Overtightening with a wrench WILL have the nut rip right through the plastic so recommend printing the knobs instead of using a wrench on the M4 nuts. Also the knob helps to cover up the rough end of the bolt that may cut you. Small and large knobs are interchangeable. 

Any file suffixed with -s means support is needed to print those.

This works best for Quest version of Onward. For Onward through Virtual Desktop there seems to be a left right rifle angle issue. Might need to rethink the controller mount to account for adjustability. 

I'm still tweaking the design, please provide feedback and if they are common concerns I will address them. Please provide suggestions as well. Thanks. 

<b>2021-06-11</b>: Added E-joint-arm-unthreaded.stl and L-clamp.stl to replace the joint arm as the existing joint-arm will rip when screwed on too tight due to print orientation. 

<b>2021-06-16</b>: Added E-joint-arm-raised-thick-capped-s.stl and I-vertical-shifter-long-s.stl to create a gap in the closer joint so the controller led's are less obstructed. This is to help reduce some random dominant hand tracking issues. 

<b>2021-06-18</b>: I'm noticing two issues myself. 1. Arms threading the rod either comes loose too easily or the prints will crack while trying to tighten, I'm going to update all arms to use clamped style with no threading as the c-clamp will be printed in a different directtion. This will also allow easy left-right mirroring for left-handed users. 2. Still noticing dominant controller losing tracking occasionally even with the increased gap from last update, still working on how to get around this, please post in comments if you have any ideas. 

<b>2021-06-20</b>: Archived the old configurations into a zip file and added a new x-offset joint. Now the dominant controller is completely visible and isn't susceptible to tracking issues. Also removed any threaded rod attachments, all parts should be c-clamped with m4 screws and nuts. I haven't had tracking issues with this design for the last 24 hours. Please let me know otherwise.

Only that way we can get to the goal. We are in different styles of gunstocks, and thats great, because yours looks quite impressive. Mine is for bottom mounted people, its like two different islands :D great job, great designHey, This is really cool and I'm super chuffed so far with the results, but you're missing a piece.  You don't have part C, though you've swapped the labels somewhere between your schematic and your file names.  But you're missing the part on the stock with the holes.  Could you please upload that?I use the free web version of Sketchup. I can share the sketchup files if you'd like. 

One way to get around the snapping is to choose a different print orientation, but printing the joint gear teeth on a different orientation is going to be messy. The other way to get around is it to increase the thickness at where it snaps, but that's near the bottom so increasing that thickness will obstruct the controller ledss. Nice.  I kinda figured that was the path you took after trying it.  It almost seems a shame to waste the threads though, they seemed to work so well until they didn't.  I wonder if it would be worthwhile to make a threaded piece with radial notches similar to the other adjustable parts that a crimp ring could mate with.  Not really a suggestion, just thinking out loud.  Are you using solidworks?So I actually updated the arms to no longer use threads. I noticed the snapping myself and also with threading it's hard to get a tight fit exactly aligned to the rest of the stock so using the clamp style to grip the arms seem like a better design. 

Thanks for the feedbacks. I'll be working on the controllers next. Let me know if you make any changes and I'll be sure to link your design in the descriptions.  Cool, will do.  I Finally got all my hardware I needed.  Two of the 3 threaded parts seem like they were two thin.  They both ended up snapping in half.  I love the indexing joints.  I was really impressed with the fit.  I think they could be even better with some way to help them spring apart when you loosen the nuts.  My thought was just squishing an o-ring in there, but I haven't tried that yet.  My biggest issue so far is actually with the controller attachment pieces which I'm pretty sure you just borrowed.  I'm thinking I'm going to modify the right hand one to add a second magnet in line with the first so it grips a little better to the pipe.

The adapter is very snug by design, you will have to force it on the first time. The mount is linked below.

I have also included the STL for the clip so you can remix this design for other flight sticks, or shifters, etc. Model is symmetric for lefties and HOSAS.

Whip out your meaty credit card from your trousers/skirt and purchase the following -

2. 4 x Arcade Buttons (of various ethnicity)

3. USB interface for joystick/buttons
https://www.jaycar.com.au/usb-interface-for-joystick-and-buttons/p/XC9046

4. Some M2/M3 fasteners and cables ties

**STEP 2 - COME ON DOOO EET**

Print both files (A and B). I designed these files to print upside down (with the cavity facing upwards) using minimal supports (just one for the USB cable hole on my slicer settings).

**STEP 3 - Amanaemonesia**

Clickety clack everything together using the practical skills you've accumulated over your life. If you're extremely young this may be hard. If you're extremely old, well done on using a computer and getting past step 2. 

***1a. Put down your joystick and stop playing with it. Before we mount any switches, we need to start with bringing both halves together to encapsulate the rubber strain relief of the USB cable. You should notice a squarish hole specifically for the rubber on the USB cable (see picture).***

***1b. Once the USB cable is in place (should protrude neatly from the back of the assembly) cable tie both halves together using four cable ties in the 8 holes (see picture). ***

***2. Mount the USB interface board using 4 screws/nuts , ensuring that the board is on the joystick side (more room). If you have mounted it on the button side, you have failed at life and should stop here.***

***3. Now you can start mounting the buttons and joystick in their respective holes.***

***4. Wire up all buttons to the USB interface, using the larger rectangular hole to feed through the button wires.***

***5. Plug the USB into a computer/raspberryPi and program the buttons ***

** STEP 3 - How did I get here? **

You are now ready to use your arcade controller and play some pirated Super Mario. If you have reached this point, find a mirror and congratulate yourself. Because no one else's opinion matters as much as your own.

I can only seem to plug this into female USB sockets? No matter how hard I try... it won't fit into any other non specific connector housing?

It did fit a Ethernet port momentarily, but it wasn't functional. Afterwards, the Ethernet port wasn't the same and has ceased communication with any other devices. 

I've tried reasoning with the USB controller, but I only found contempt and was belittled on social media for having expectations that the USB controller would happily conform and operate as intended.

Look, I've tried everything. But being a middle aged white male... I'm honestly starting to wonder if it was worth trying at all. I mean. I never had a problem with USB... I just assumed that it would just plug in and work just like all of my other devices. I was willing to put in the effort to make it work. But I just don't think it wants to get along with any other devices.

I get it... it wants to be different. But does it have to be so difficult to get along with? What about my feelings? What about my expectations and my beliefs? Don't they count also? 

For now I think the USB Arcade Controller will just have to agree to disagree... I've tried, boy i've tried. Maybe one day... USB will understand that everyone matters. We all have to get along. And sometimes, just sometimes... somethings are just mean't to work a certain way.

A dribble of superglue on the sides of the fan and lids keeps it together, double sided tape/foam, gently sticks it to the top of the Rift. I used 3AA batteries to power it, but I leave that all up to you.
You will need to make two small holes in the facial interface, I used a Dremel but a delicately applied soldering iron would probably do the trick too.

I have had one test session of 3hr and results are reasonably positive. No dry shriveled up eyeballs and more importantly, not sweaty and uncomfortable.

The mount holds on pretty tight by itself, but you can always add a little bit of double-sided tape to the top of your webcam to add that little bit of extra grip.  

You will need a 1/2 inch 1/4x20 bolt or screw to attach the Vive tracker to the mount.  This is a standard camera mount thread.

23-8-2018  Added an untested version of the mount with a nut slot to keep the screw in place and cut holes for the microphones built into the camera.  If you print this version please let me know of any problems with it.  I do not have a way to test for quite some time.

I modified v2 of the top portion to be a lens cover/protector instead of a prescription lens holder. I loved the magnet idea for the lenses and thought this would be perfect for a lens cover as well. All the other lens covers work great but they either take up a bunch of room, cover the sensor turning on the quest, or are too small. This is a nice and compact way to protect the lenses and provide the ease of the magnets for easy putting on and off. Its especially nice if you have the VR Cover facial interface, like me, as this will fit that where as many other lens covers are too big or too small for that.

I included the bases from the magnetic lenses, however if you are looking for the top part with the prescription lenses definitely go check out jegstads thing. Its awesome.

The magnets used in the original are 5mm x 2mm disc magnet, however I got away with 2 5mm x 1mm disks connected together, because thats what I had laying around. Make sure you orient the magnets in the correct way so the polarity on the bottom portion snaps the top piece in.

Originally there was thin rubber frame between shell and LCD, but with new LCD gap is much bigger, as shown in the images.

So I modeled thicker replacement to try and close this gap. On comparison image above my version is one the right, original rubber is on the left. I skipped on making square cuts on the right side because these were holes for clips that were holding old LCD in it's frame so they were not needed any more. New frame closes this gap. It doesn't actually comes in contact with new LCD, I tried sliding piece of paper between them and it slid effortlessly. Which is fine as I wanted to avoid making pressure on LCD.

At first I thought that you created a centering bracket for the McWill Screen. That would have been awesome, too. Yep this one Hi there, nice remix.

Centering bracket: do you mean this one by the seller Silvanus83?I have seen centering brackes (for the upcoming GameGear replacement screens from retrokai ) on ebay. But since the screens are the same it should fit also the McWill screens. Since it's ebay i won't link it here.Original McWill screen is usually joined with PCB so it's not ""free floating"" so you just slide pcb+screen onto Game Gear motherboard. If you align PCB holes with motherboard holes screen will be centered. I think only with chinese clones screens are not attached to PCBs. So I didn't have problems with screen centering. It was automatically OK. Hmm, I'll have to look into that then. I didn't have need to take any special steps to make it centered so it didn't occurred to me. I'll check if there can be some way to add something to help with that. I have one more working Game Gear that'll probably get this screen one day so I may need it in the end :).I have modded about 6 Game Gears with a McWill Screen and his pcb is not exact, so I always had to readjust. I think just a bracket for the bottom would be enough, so you have the right straight height and then you just have to align it left/right till it’s perfectly centered. "

That's dust messing up the rubber. Gets me really, really annoyed... so I made a solution! All of these are caps to slide on top of the analog sticks to protect them. There's ones for the Dual Sock 4, for the... stick extenders? I bought for the Dual Shock 4 (so probably useless for everybody else), for the Joycons, for the Switch Pro Controller, for the Steam Controller and for the Wii U.

There's a logo on all of them so to avoid mixing if you print multiple (because *obviously* they all have different diameters... ffs) but other than the PlayStation logo that came out quite nice after printing, and the Wii U one that's still ok, the others are more along the lines of ""it's the thought that matters"". If one of the dozens of us that has a Steam Controller wants to print that one, well I forgot to mirror the logo so maybe do that in the slicer. The normal one for PS4 is the ""PS4.stl"".

Depending on your printer's accuracy and the level of wear of the sticks themselves you might want to print them a little bigger to slide them in better.

They take like 10 minutes each, I got a whole batch in 2 hours.

Edit:There's a new file, the 8BitDo SN30 pro +.stl for that controller. Mine is a little loose, but not enough to fall if the controller is upside down. The logo is far too detailed, maybe with a good resin printer...

Edit, again: I got a Razer Kishi and as a result I made one for that too. Sadly the Razer logo is too detailed and, uh, Tinkercad didn't like the SVG so I had to go with a sad ""R"". Fits wonderfully though! As a side note it's the iPhone version, I sure hope they kept the same sticks between the Android and iOS versions but it's better to point that out.

Further edit: Now with support for the Stadia controller! The logo is even printed decently, so it's one of the best, nice.

The heels and toes bolt on with 1/4""-28 x 1.25"" socket head cap screws. Seems very sturdy. I sized the adapters for the metric bolts and nuts that come with the factory adapters.

I’ve been using mine since this was posted last November and no problems. I needed a narrower stance so my pedals would fit inside a motion platform frame I built and I just like the narrower stance anyway. And I did use PLA for my print. I dont have a big build volume so that’s why the pedals were segmented to bolt together, but I think the metal bolts may also strengthen though maybe it’s a wash. Not sure. But they seem very sturdy and I’ve had no problems at all with them.Hey, first thanks a lot for this outstanding design! Great for my small airliner cockpit...

When gluing the logo in place make sure to align the logo parts with the visible surface facing down on the print bed for a better surface finish. The parts also may require some post processing.

After having sacrificed my right controller to the Echo gods, I poked around online for a protector, and found nothing here.  I did some research to see what sort of designs were already out there, and based my design off of a Quest controller protector, called ""The Hardcore"" that I saw on Facebook.

I printed one and it fits nicely. No problems putting it on the contoller at all.

However it doesn’t seem to offer a lot of protection.
There is only a small rim to the front that would offer a bit of protection.
From the sides it offers no protection at all.
Most material is inside the ring where it doesn’t need protection.

Thanks for the work you put into it, and thanks for sharing anyway.Really awesome design... fits perfectly....

Are they identical or is there a left and right?

The only thing i find is that they rotate a little when fitted.. if you could extend the ring and close the gap a little they would only sit in one position......"

I love this device but found my hands cramping up while playing some games. My solution is this simple grip that slides into the device and locks into place with the screw-holes in the back. 

I've been using mine for about a week and it has not caused any scratches or marks on the case of the system. However, if you print this for yourself be careful of the fit, because every printer is different. The grip should slide easily onto the system but feel firm once it's in-place. It's also easy to remove by flexing the grip backwards just a little and then sliding it back off.

You can probably use this for a lot of other functions since it's just a simple switch. My favorite examples (off the top of my head):

- Arm to deploy parachutes or other single-use functions
- Rocket boost lever
- A lever for your evil henchmen
- Cookie dispenser
- Vegetable dispenser

The arm will rotate about 45 degrees before it hits the switch. Since I am in the US, and it's easy and cheap to find inch sized fasteners, the arm's shaft is a 1/4"" threaded rod. All other fasteners were designed as metric fitment. I did include a couple extra versions of shaft pieces to help use a metric threaded rod. Here is a list of the parts and what you can use instead:

- Arm frame - this is the base for everything, and is common for all parts
- Bearing Pivot - three provided, all use the same bearing, but there are three versions with the appropriate hole and square nut cutout for your threaded rod of choice. Make sure you print the flat side down. Note that the bearing will press in from the side that faces up when printed flat side down. There is a little lip to stop the bearing once it's pressed in.
- Knob - just a simple grip knob, again three versions for your threaded rod (this is a good simple part to get your feet wet in design if you want to make it your own - it has no impact on the performance besides how it feels in your hand). A locking nut fits in the top, and I used a washer and nut to jam against the bottom to keep it from wanting to spin.
- Spring block - only two of these, since the 1/4"" and M6 are able to both use the same one. This slides down the rod to hold a bolt for the springs which go on either side.
- Switch spacer - make sure you print 2! common for all parts. Just some simple spacers to locate your switch appropriately.

The hardware you'll need:

- qty. 1 of M8, M6, or 1/4"" threaded rod - I used a 6.5"" / ~165mm length, but feel free to use one longer or shorter for personal preference
- qty. 2 of M8, M6, or 1/4"" regular hex nuts - These go on the arm shaft, and are to jam against the spring block and knob and keep them from wobbling or walking around.
- qty. 1 of M8, M6, or 1/4"" locking nut - I prefer this on the top of the knob to help keep it from loosening and James Hunt Japan 1976'ing you.
- qty. 1 of M8, M6, or 1/4"" square nut - This goes in the rectangle cutout in the pivot. The sizes are 13mm, 10mm, and 7/16"", respective to the given shaft size. There is a bit of tolerance built into this to make it a tight fit with respect to the slight shrinkage that happens in 3D printing. Be prepared to use clamps to squeeze the nut into place. Mine was able to just push in with my thumb.
- qty. 2 of coil springs - I found two in a pack of random springs I got at Home Depot, they have the ends bent so that the last couple coils make for loops you can put bolts through. Mine measure roughly 33mm center-to-center of those end loops. You should have some freedom to use a lot of different springs here, as long as they fit.
- qty. 2 of M5 x 25mm bolts, w/ locking nuts and washers - These hold the springs in place. I used locking nuts so I didn't have to fully cinch the springs down (allows them to pivot), but the bolt won't loosen over time.
- qty. 2 of M3 x 30 mm bolts w/ locking nuts - These hold the switch down, with the two spacers sandwiched between the switch and frame upright
- qty. 1 of momentary microswitch - Make sure you can use 3mm bolts through it, and make sure it fits. I used switch # V-153-1V25 that I had on hand, but I gave the frame long slots for the mounting bolts to allow some freedom. You can also print more spacers to stack up and space the switch you use if it's narrower than 10 mm.
- qty. 1 of M8 x 30 bolt w/ washer and locking nut - For mounting the bearing to the frame and acting as the axle. Put the washer on the nut side on the back, so that it doesn't interfere with the bearing, and also to spread the load on the plastic better
- qty. 1 of 608-2RS (or equivalent size) ball bearing - Pretty self explanatory. Another press fit, so keep the clamps out. A nut or washer works well to push it down against the little stop built in
- qty. 2 of screws to fasten to your surface - I'm leaving this one open ended for requirements since it will have to be tailored to your surface. I am using American #8 wood screws, but any flat head (bugle shaped) machine screw would also work if you want to bolt it down instead. IMPORTANT: because of how the layers print, make sure you drill the holes to allow your screw to push through by hand. If you don't, the layers can easily split at the screw, and you'll have to wait for a new frame to print. Ask me how I know.
- a small cabinet bumper - this fits on the pad behind the spring block on the frame. Keeps the noise and damage down.


I think assembly is pretty straight forward, just use the reference image. You're on your own for wiring and making it work with your computer. There are guides on the internet that would do a much better job than I. Your choice of Teensy or Arduino or similar should work great.

will try another design because I still want to sore it in my case and I often use my joy-con sideway for multi-player. 

yeah, I used e6000 glue. it's like a strong rubber cement so it comes off fairly easy of it needs to. I tried several other ways and couldn't get any to work well enough.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Wartortle (カメール Kamēru, Kameil), known as the Turtle Pokémon, is the evolved form of Squirtle. It has a slightly more intimidating appearance than its preceding form; aside from an increased height and weight, it now has darker skin, eyes with smaller pupils, and two protruding fangs. Its shell may receive scars from battles that these Pokémon seek out.[45] A Wartortle also gets a pair of feathery ears, and its tail becomes white, fluffy, and too long to completely hide within its shell;[46] these appendages greatly aid this Pokémon in swimming, acting as oars and/or fins.[47] The tail also happens to be a highly valued collectors' item, which has caused people to hunt this Pokémon, dwindling their numbers. The reason for such poaching may very well be that a Wartortle tail is a symbol of longevity in the Pokémon world, supposedly allowing the creature to live for thousands of years.[48]

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Ivysaur (フシギソウ Fushigisō, Fushigisou), known as the Seed Pokémon, represents the evolved form of Bulbasaur, one of the three starting Pokémon available to players in Pokémon Red and Blue and their various remakes; it evolves into the final form of Venusaur. Aside from becoming taller and heavier than Bulbasaur, its trademark bulb becomes a pink flower-bud, and four leaves now appear at the base of this bud. The Pokémon's legs are more stout, allowing it to hold up the bigger bulb, yet limiting its previous ability to stand on its hind legs.[2] Its eyes now look more aggressive and intimidating. As before, Ivysaur and its bulb share a mutualistic relationship; bathing in sunlight allows both to continue growing.[3] Eventually, the bud will give off a sweet scent, a signal that it will bloom soon, and that its host will evolve. An Ivysaur will spend more time bathing in sunlight in order to reach evolution.[4]

The idea behind this is to use RetroDeck to operate OBS-Studio, mute the microphone and launch sounds from a sound deck.
At the moment I use it to play sounds during our gaming session via the macro buttons of VoiceMeeter Banana and as a throat button.
The Arduino Pro Mico is recognized as a keyboard by Win10 and passes keyboard commands. In my case Ctrl+F1-F9 and Shift+F1-F6.

However, it IS nested in the sense that the base is four separate corner pieces, so you can print the back in up to a four-color ""checkerboard""!  I chose not to, but the option is nice to have... Anyways!

This is just a simple game card holder I designed to fit in my AmazonBasics Vault Case.  [Link](https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Vault-Case-Nintendo-Switch-Red/dp/B07348551R?th=1).  I don't get paid for that link, just being helpful~.

You will need to cut the foam back out so that you have enough clearance and not risk scratching your screen, but that's really easy to do with a fresh exacto blade.

<li>No support is needed</li>
<li>Different placements for the magnets and sensors (Linear movements)</li>
<li>Brakes are non linear for better control</li>
<li>Software debounce for the digital switches</li>

<li>Cable management</li>
<li>Trap nuts and screws to secure the parts on the shafts</li>
<li>Stronger solution for the centering string (still in testing bunch of holes already included)</li>
<li>All the printed parts are included</li>
<li>Word document for the assembly</li>
<li>Build material list with links</li>

Add this Library to Arduino:<br>https://github.com/MHeironimus/ArduinoJoystickLibrary/archive/refs/heads/master.zip

And I use Sparkfun Pro Micro to program my boards, add to the Arduino Preferences Additional URL:<br>https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sparkfun/Arduino_Boards/master/IDE_Board_Manager/package_sparkfun_index.json

<li>Throttle2  = A9</li>
<li>Rudder    = A10</li>

Digital switch connections are 2-7, 14, 15 and 16.

At this stage the program will output all analog values to the serial port so we can use the serial plotter (115200 bauds) and see the behaviour, disable this with debug = 0 in the setup.

This is a frame for a 10.1 inch screen (of an old EEEPC in this case)adapted to the bracket of Saitek flight modules.

Look at the pictures of my cockpit for an idea of the result!

You will need :
- for the two parts of the frame:
- 2 M3 x 8mm bolts
- 2 M3 nuts
- to attach the screen to the back of the frame:
- 4 M3 x 5mm bolts
- to fix everything on the Saitek supports:
- 4 M4 x 18mm bolts

I also put the STEP file to adapt this to the screen that you could recover.

Note: I use Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020. To put the instruments on second screen I use either the function integrated into FS for the G1000 or a third-party tool for the analog instruments.

Also wanted something to be able to easily cover the lens when configuring the system with the lightgun plugged in so my cursor wasn't always bouncing here and there.

Note 1: You need to remove the included orange tip so that it fits on there. Feel free to print this in orange so you feel safer. ;)

If people really really want I will create one as well that covers the orange tip if people prefer that style.

Note 2: The pictures are the first draft that was at 13mm height which left too much space between the lens and the front so dropped it to 11mm which seems about perfect.

Printing:

Nothing fancy here, just sliced it with Cura on Dynamic Quality (0.16mm) since it's a quick 35 minute print with no supports or brim needed. Printed on a stock Ender 3 V2.

Just drag the Z vertical down so that the front ""lens"" portion is below the bed then when it slices it will ignore that portion and just print the ring itself. You can measure the existing orange ring it came with to get the exact same sizing if you want it to be a near perfect replacement in whatever color you decide to print it in.

Let me know how it goes and if you can't get it right I'll see what I can do. Good luck!Hello, may I request version which covers also the ring?

I believe that would make the joint stronger. I changed the orientation, because I wanted the part that shows, to look as clean as possible.

I printed two of these with PLA at 20% infill and they are quite strong.

Are you using this as a VIBs switcher on ALP?

I attached mine to my ALP with double sided tape and believe the tape would fail, before joint would."

I imported it into SketchUp Make and I was hoping I could just change a parameter of a face from AxB to the 5c dimensions. But it looks likes because of the slight angle on the upper-part, I can't do that. It looks like the distance from the bottom to the top is about 66mm, so I suspect if I could just trim off a few mm it would work fine. Some of the segments on the arm seem really straight (like the first and some in the middle) --- would you recommend trying to cut those out and move it to get the right size?

Also, are you happy with the angle of the arm? I compared to my 3DS XL and it has three settings and I prefer the middle one and the angle is about 150 degs.

Print the following:
1 Butt
2 Base blocks
2 Latches
2 guide rails
1 Tube end
1 drill guide (used to make even marks on tube for drilling retention holes, you do not have to print the entire thing, you can print only half of it but I suggest at least 3 holes)

You will also need to find some grips on Thingiverse for whatever type of controller you have.  There are plenty out there.  Just be sure that the bottom is FLAT so that you can glue it to the base blocks.

You will need the following items to complete the stock:

2 springs (sold in packs  https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XPG813G/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o05_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1

24 inch aluminum or CF tube 1"" outer diameter.  I bought this and cut it.  You can make this as long as you would like, just print out an extra guide rail if you are really tall.  If you go with a 2 foot tube, you can make 3 stocks with this  https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005IZ37HU/ref=oh_aui_bia_detailpage_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1

Two of these

assembly is fairly strait forward.

Push the butt onto the aluminum tube and drill through the two holes.  Install the long threaded post to hold butt on.  You may have to lightly sand the hole in the butt to accommodate your tube, alternatively you can sand the tube.  Go slowly as a tight fit is preferred.

Glue the two guide rails together with super glue.  Once dry lay the flat side on a table and put super glue in the trough that faces upwards.  Then put the rail guide nipple into the recess in the butt and push the tube down onto the guide rails.  Doing this with the guide rails flat on the table ensures the guide rails glue to the tube strait.  You can put a lot of pressure on the tube to get a good bond.

Now trim the excess Guide rail off the end of the tube, make it flush and neat looking.

Use the Drill guide by putting it over the tube.  Use a punch in each hole on what will be the bottom of the tube, then move the guide and repeat.  This will give evenly spaced holes.  I didnt do the entire length of the tube, but you certainly can if you want more adjustment points.  Once all the holes are marked drill them out with a 1/4 inch drill bit.  Best if you have a drill press but not necessary if you used a good center punch.

Now take the base block and latches and drill out their holes to the same size as the threaded post.  Put a spring in the top hole of the latch.  Put the latch in place and put the shorter threaded post through the holes and tighten.

Finally, glue your grips to the base blocks.  Lightly sand the areas that will come in contact before you glue.  I used gorilla super glue and it makes an extremely strong bond with PLA.  If you print in ABS I do not know what would be best.

Slide the base block onto the tube and You are all set!",,[],7,472,881,0,0,0,Gadgets,video-games,

I figured while I was at it I'd remix it with some other designs I may make for some friends and that others would like too.

Flip them over so they're face down like the original case. If you want to ensure the design prints well you can leave them in their current orientation, but it will take twice the time and material due to all the supports andthe tabs inside may not print right.

These designs are only 0.4-0.5mm deep to keep the case from being too thin and the cuts are pretty narrow, so if you flip them face down many of them should be printable without support, maybe with the exception of something like the Triforce, Metroid, and Super Smash. Even then it would only be one layer. You can see in my make how it turned out with supports, as it only prints the one layer of support brim and any first layer smooshing makes it impossible to remove. It looks neat in it's own way, but it's not as intended.

The Zelda Sword and Zelda Eye designs have details that will not slice even with a 0.2mm nozzle, but it doesn't detract from their appearance IMHO.

A drum shaped gear sits under the main drive gear and lifts the laser assembly. The cage that supports that drum gear fractures, the only way to fix it is to glue it which is not a long term solution.

This wheel gets somewhere around 900 degrees of rotation. It's geared to a 10k potentiometer of standard size. 

I use a set of foot pedals from a broken PS2 wheel I got at a thrift store, but there are several designs elsewhere on thingiverse.

standard 10k potentiometer

2x 605 bearings
2x 8mm or 5/16th bolts, hex head
2x 6mm bolts with wing nuts for mounting
3x 5mm bolts for connecting the frame to the back bracket
some 3mm bolts for mounting the potentiometer bracket and other things


The electronics uses an arduino pro mini and NRF24L01 wireless board put together dead bug style and powered by an 18650. The NRF is powered through a diode to make sure the voltage doesn't exceed its 3.3v rating.

The receiver is an arduino micro with an NRF board as well.

The arduino code is here:

Some people may wonder about the latency. I tested it and found that there is about 7-8ms of latency, which is better than some of the current gen console wireless controllers.

I am French, so sorry for my question :

Have you got the ""power switch button"" ? My button is broken .... Hi there,

The console bottom file appears to have a little issue. it seems that the bottom has a sort of boxed area attached to the top. I've looked in a few different slicers and it appears to be the same. Is there any possibility you could provide another stl for the console bottom? Many thanksCan't see anything...Tried sending you a message right after to posted this guessing it didn't go through, but ya, it's okay that it scales to 10000% Blender models do that for some reason. The print should turn out fine.

One thing though. The PC Engine had two models. One of which the RF box was slightly put towards the back. Just FYI, I only had the first model so you may have to alter it if you're replacing it for a later one. :)The scaling will be okay. Being made in Blender it always scales up to that in Cura.

Keep in mind though that there is a revisioned model where the RF input was slightly back farther. I didn't have the specs for this model as I only had the first version to scale off of. So if you plan on putting an actual PC Engine board into this it may have to be altered a bit. Just FYI. :)Thank SO much! this is very much a ""holy grail"" print for me so I can't tell you how grateful I am. Out of curiosity, what scale do you print this at? My Cura has scaled it to 10,000% of the original size. Looks like it will print at the right size but wanted to check with you. Thanks again!I take it back, it was easy enough. Seems like I left in the sizing meshes. lol It's fixed now. Once again thank you for pointing this out.Comment has been deletedHey man, thank you so much for answering so soon.

I hate to bother you here on thingiverse, but do you have a list of the components you removed when you uninstalled the LCD? I removed my LCD and a few other components that I thought were required to remove, and now I'm only getting a clicking sound when I power the board on with a game. Haven't installed the ggtv yet, but assumed I should get the game audio still....

Very much appreciate the help. Awesome work!
Do you perhaps have pictures of the boards installed? I'm having a hard time visualizing how the mini DIN pcb would be secured into place, I'm assuming it goes in the large square port in the center of the back, opposite the cartridge slot.

Also, would you be okay with me remixing this to make it printable by smaller printers? 
(Meaning printing in 4 parts instead of two and securing the halves together with screws, probably m2.5 screws.) 
I want to check you're okay with someone posting a remix before I put so much time into it. 


Thanks,
BTHi, can you tell me which output connector you used? 
Also the controller pcb is out of stock. Any idea where i can get on? Or maybe a similar one. 

Regards AlexThanks! Feel free to remix, I've been meaning to do that myself for a while now but there's been quite a few more requests on the Virtualboy case.  I'll add a picture here for the insides. Or if you need more you can dm me on Twitter @marcus9199 . I'm also working on a new design for game gear using the mcwill mod. It should be quite a bit more compact.  Oh and yes the lid uses m2.5 the insides are held in with the stick screws.The controller ports are back in stock, sure enough i won't do a pad hack xDhttps://oshpark.com/shared_projects/37rGIZ8P this is the board I'm using.

4659075,Plug and Play RetroPie Arcade,https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/e9/a5/68/ff/0c/large_display_RetroPi_High_Quality.jpg,2020-11-22,14,17,2,"Overview:
===
I designed this to be a simple looking and easy to assemble RetroPie arcade. There's a top and bottom that slide into each other and are secured with 4 M3x10 screws. The controls and Raspberry Pi are housed in a single unit. HDMI and power come out the back of the device so be mindful to order cables that are long enough to work with whatever set up you have.

I printed the device on a Prusa Mk3s and the parts labeled ""A"" and ""B"" will fit on the build plate of that. I used epoxy to attach the two halves, but whatever you have may. I've included the full body for both the top and the bottom so you can cut them in whichever way best fits your printer.

There are two different button hole diameters, 30mm and 25mm, which should fit most arcade buttons as long as the have a larger diameter nut to capture the underside. The joystick is mounted using four M3 screws and nuts (I included them in the call out for M3s for consistency, but any length over 5mm will work for these). 

Warning!
===
The Raspberry Pi is designed to be mounted using M2.5s! I chose to use M3s for part consistency (and they are also often easier to find). While the mounting holes of the Pi have a 2.9mm diameter, you will be cutting into the board a little if you use M3s. I was able to mount the Pi and have the system work fine without much worry but if you decide to use M3s **please be careful while mounting to avoid breaking the PCB**.

Low profile HDMI cable: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B074VBWPMZ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1

Assembly:
===
1. Place four nuts into slots along the rim of the base.

2. Mount the non-printed components. Use caution for the Pi as mentioned above. Additionally the standoffs have printed threads. It is unlikely that the printer is able to print them perfectly intact so you will likely feel the resistance of cutting into the plastic. Use the remaining nuts to mount the joystick. Route HDMI and power out of the back of the devise.

3. Slide the top onto the bottom and attach the wires for the buttons and joystick. The top slides on at a slight angle so be mindful of that. The wires are long enough, but don't leave too too much wiggle room. It may be beneficial to prop the top on something or have an extra person available to hold it while attaching it to the board.

4. Screw in the external screws.

5. Enjoy RetroPie!

I was able to print and test everything, but it you encounter issues or have design suggestions please let me know!

I think I put a 12V version in it and it worked fine ever since (but I didn't do any lengthy gameplay).

The PS2 version was modified from it since a friend of mine needed it. I haven't tried it on my own PS2s yet.

All I know is we used Noctua fans exclusively. And they didn't give us any problem.Okay, i tried this and this mod isn't exactly great. You really can't just mount a 40x10 fan and expect it to work.

In order to make a 40x10 fan work, you MUST add a boost converter. The Playstation 2 supplies the fan with 5-6 Volts (7-8 Volts with the HDD running).

I tried this with a Noctua NF-A4x10 and the fan didn't reliably spin up while running a game off the disc. When i run a game from the HDD, the fan spins up reliably. However the PS2 eventually overheats.

In order to create enough airflow and make sure the fan is always running, you have to solder in a boost converter and then set the voltage to 12 Volts. Also cut away the big circle in the fan grill because that also heavily obstructs the airflow. Please note that the fan won't be running silently anymore with the boost converter since we force the fan to run at maximum power.

With all that said: Jeff, how did you even manage to cool your PSX? Because i had to do a lot of steps to make a 40x10 fan work in my PS2, a system which doesn't easily overheat. You on the other hand put a 40x20 fan in a system that is notorious for overheating. HOW?how does it look like when its on the PS2. if possible can you upload a image. thank youI see that the noctua fan you are using is a 3 pin, but the phat PS2 uses a 2 pin connector, did you just solder directly to the board or get a adapter cable?I cut off the plug of the original fan and spliced it onto the noctua fan. For PS2 you only need the Vcc and GND. The yellow TAC wire can be omitted. Just wrap it inside a heat-shrink tube."

After spending days looking for good Head Track model I decided to model it myself.

To print use settings:

* Use 0.15 layer hight or less

* More than 30% infill

* At least 3 outter perimeter layers

* Supports for ""Clip"" model (FROM BUILD PLATFORM ONLY!!! Otherwise supports will be built inside)

* Supports for Cover model (Normal supports)

* Supports for ""Holder"" model (FROM BUILD PLATFORM ONLY)

* 200 - 220 °C on Nozzle

For assembly You will need few 15-20mm long wood screws to connect joints on holder and clip, and one M2 screw with nut for headphones attaching parts.

It's hard to make all the wires trough and needs some nerves to acomplish.

For powering use 1.5V battery, no resistors needed, or
use resistor to drop voltage to 2V at least when powering from computer USB port...

Use with PS3 eye camera for best FPS and I found out that opentrack is the best app for headtracking, so I recommend You to use it. FreeTrack is also OK but it does not support 64 bit applications.

Pros:

    Significant weight reduction through the removal of a 14g inner hull.
    150mah Lipo Power System, significantly lighter than an AA battery.
    USB-C rechargable, charges in ~40 min, lasts 50 hrs.

    Uses original outer shells, so it looks stock and feels nice
    Charging port integrates nondestrucively with the rest of the mouse
    DPI button is moved to a nicer place, can be rebound to an in game function

Cons:

    Still can't use the mouse while charging. The charging circuit only allows usage OR charging, one at a time.
    Depending on what material you print with, the magnet holder might become looser over time (material creep). If the magnet pops out, it can be glued back in.

There's a number of these on Thingiverse, but I thought it would be neat if the controllers formed the Valve Index Controllers logo when docked! This meant I needed a dock that had the controllers side-by-side, and since one didn't exist, I made one! The ring around the top is supposed to resemble the sensor ring on the controllers themselves, but I could only get it so close in TinkerCAD.

I originally tried to make this 100% from scratch, but I couldn't get the socket to hold the controllers firmly in place. They kept falling off the dock, and this actually resulted in one of my controllers breaking! So I borrowed the socket from BearCubsTeacher's dock, it's a perfect fit! I also borrowed his Index logo too, it really completes the look!

I recommend giving the socket a sand after printing, since it's pretty rough. You don't want your controllers getting scratched! The logo should snap into the socket on the front of the dock, but you need to make sure any excess plastic has been trimmed off.

Link is down in the misc. notes.
...

Now I'm on v3 of my Digital arcade Flightstick series I am starting to think it shouldn't be digital anymore, so I have searched down a not-too-expensive (read: cheap) arcade analog stick and placed an order. I did consider the Ultimarc UltraStik (especially the 360FS) but the cost was high and you could buy an off the shelf analog stick for less.

If anybody has a spare UltraStik or knows of a cheap way to get one to Australia please message me.

Anyway, continuing on from my other flightsticks, ""The Raptor"" is relatively simple to print and requires only 8 of a single type of push button to be ready for battle! 
Obviously, you will need to wire up the buttons, have a Sanwa clone joystick to plant it on and an encoder to interface with your chosen device.

The reason this version has a separate front cover is so you can consolidate the ground wires from the back 5 buttons, thus reducing the amount of wiring running through the body. I also would suggest feeding a wire up to the trigger push button location from the bottom, the turn is a little tight to be able to feed it from the top.

As a connection suggestion, considering that there are 8 fire buttons and a ground wire you could use a coiled spring type cable terminating in a 9pin D plug with a connector situated on the front of your control panel, or just under if it overhangs.

I hope someone gets as much of a kick out of this as I did designing and making it, this is not the end of the flightstick series but I might have a go at a few others things in the meantime.

There are two versions of the main body, one is lighter, takes less material and time to print, and the other is stronger.

_336L means: 3 top layers, 3 bottom layers, 6% infill and L is Line infill.
_4415H means: 4 top layers, 4 bottom layers, 15% infill and H is Hex infill.

Description 
====================
A Need for Speed Hot Pursuit theme display base for 2 1/64 scale cars.

The cars I used in the photos are Mini GT Pagani Huayra Roadster and Tarmac Works Lamborghini LP750-4 SV NFS Police. I used those 2 cars because I couldn't find a orange Zonda Cinque and police Reventon but these 2 look similar enough from far. 

If you wish to have a display base tweaked to fit to a different car from a different brand, please send me these dimension for the display base holes: https://imgur.com/5T6mb2L

The display base is separated into 2 parts for easy printing and colour swap. The parts are:

1) Base (BaseV3.STL)
2) Flat Base (FlatBase.STL)

Print Settings
====================
Nozzle size = 0.3 mm (Should be printable with 0.4)
Layer height = 0.28 mm (I set to 0.28mm just to print it faster)

Filament change layer for colours on ""FlatBase.STL"":
1) Start (Lines on the road, mine is in white)
2) Layer 4 (Road colour, mine is in black)
3) Layer 6 (""NEED FOR SPEED"" lettering and NFS logo colour, mine is in white)
4) Layer 10 (""HOT PURSUIT"" colour, mine is in red)

Assembly
====================
The car is tied by wires through the hole in the base

Flat base will need to be glued or double sided tape on to the base, the flat base will fall off if there is no glue or tape. 

Others
====================
Feel free to send me any feedback on how to improve the design. Suggestion on display base designs are welcomed too.

Sorry, but since Thingiverse changed the way files are zipped together with the maker's ""Thing number"" embedded in a text file, I simply CAN NOT seem to find the original file (See Update Below!!) that I modified heavily with the original Non-Slotted Headset holder, But when I find the link, I'll post it!  It's an Awesome file, but it only allowed the Quest 2 headset to sit on it ""Nose Facing Toward Wall"", and I needed the Headset to sit ""Nose facing out"" so I can see the charging lights on our Quest 2 Headsets from my desk more easily... I had to extend the holder a good deal, Change the curves where the ""nose"" of the headset sits so it'll hang properly in either direction while still supporting the face-shield, and put a wide slot in it so the Headset's Top Strap could fit through it when I sit the Headset on the mount, ""Nose Facing Out"".

WALI C-Clamp Base Stand Mounting Accessory for WALI Monitor Mount Workstation System (C-CLAMP), Black


My remix completely reworks the original to use the above beefy clamp and to combined the T and Main into one object.  I also added a spine to the bottom for extra rigidity.  

Printing the set burns a 1kg spool of filament - easy.  Start with a fresh spool!  If your printer can handle the height, print from the clamp side resting on the bed and use rectilinear infill of about 20%.  This makes it very sturdy.  From the clamp to the tip of the base is 281.5mm.  My SeeMeCNC Rostock can handle 400mm high so its why I went this route.  Sorry if this exceeds your print size.  Use it as an excuse to upgrade your printer!  Print time was about 17 hours and 39 minutes.

I have made two sets of these now and both are perfect for what my friend and I needed.  The clamp I chose is the same used to mount monitor arms to your desk.  Its overkill, but the stick and throttle are very secure.  As a bonus you can mount something to the top of the clamp.  I plan on working on a custom USB button panel...

I ditched the plastic 3D printed bolts and purchased 4 M6-1.00x60 bolts to secure the base.  You will also need to get 2 M8-1.25x30 bolts to secure the bracket.

Thanks!Took me long enough, but I finally [remixed this](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4916743) and got it uploaded. Thanks again!I will, once I print out a second one for the throttle. I need to tweak the diameters of the holes - and build some test pieces to confirm they're right before printing the entire thing again. I ended up with holes that were too tight, had to ream them out with a slightly too small bit and then use some mechanical persuasion (hammer) to get everything in. I'm sure I can do better the second time :)

All that said, this thing is built like a tank. The clamps you chose are brilliant, and provide an incredibly solid connection to my desk. The whole kit feels far more robust than it should for $35 worth of plastic and metal. Well done!Thank you for the appreciative comment. Once in a while I knock one out of the park. Nice! Are you going to post a remix?  I would love to see how you split it up. Awesome, thank you!

I'd already tried using the mount you based this on, and found it lacking in the joint, so the idea of a one-piece design was appealing. However, I've got a Prusa i3, so that wasn't going to work. I ended up splitting your design about halfway along the base, and to beef it back up at the joint I put a couple of 6mm holes, 40mm deep, on each piece. I have some 79mm lengths of some stainless steel straws I used for another project that should work well to provide support and make the joint bombproof, once epoxied in. M8-1.25 x 30 are the bolts you will need to get to attach the clamp."

If not add a little blu tack or something to help the print grip the console more.

----


So I used Dotmaster5 mount to wall mount my PS4 Pro, but what about my external HDD?
Get a long cable?
Have it hanging off the cable?

The spacing just fits for a Seagate 4TB Expansion Portable Drive.
I did a rough guess of 20mm.
So if your HDD is thicker or a lot thinner, you will need to alter this in tinkercad or fusion360 for hobbyists.

Print holds with friction fit.
Depending on the weight of you drive you make want to increase the thickness of the tabs which slide onto the PS4 to have a tighter fit, or if you have some foam tape add some to the tabs.
So it'll be up to you to judge, my PS4 is just above a table so if the drive slide off, it wont be damaged. But if you have it halfway up a wall with nothing under it, then you'll want a really tight fit to prevent the print sliding off.

The filament hinge idea came from [another switch stand](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2174545/). The modification allows the stand to be printed flat rather than on it's side and requires no support. Filament is pushed through and the ends melted to make flat heads which keep them in place. Melting is done with a flat headed soldering iron. Leave 2-3 mm of filament and press the flat tipped iron onto the end. With a steady hand you can get a nice flat head on the end of the hinge pins. Do a few practice runs first.

It's perfect for the rear-view mirror or Christmas tree.

If you've got a multi-material printer, you can print sheikah_ornament_symbol.stl in your chosen colour, and sheikah_ornament_ice.stl in a clear filament, which gives the symbol the appearance of being of being embedded in a chunk of ice, and glows nicely when light shines through it.

If you want to print it on a single-extruder machine, use sheikah_ornament_onepiece.stl.  

The print in the cover photo was done on a quad extruder Prusa i3 MK2 MMU as follows:

- **sheikah_ornament_ice.stl** *3D Solutech Natural Clear PLA (extruder 1)*
- **sheikah_ornament_symbol.stl** *3D Solutech See Through Aqua Blue PLA (extruder 2)*

If you're printing with clear filament, pay close attention to the infill pattern you choose, as it will be visible when light shines through the ornament.

I have included the Fusion 360 and MeshMixer source files used to create the ornament for those who may want to tweak/tinker.  Note that the _ice_ model was exported from Fusion 360 and modified in MeshMixer using the sculpt tool to make it look more ice-like - the _ice_ body in Fusion 360 looks much simpler.


Happy printing!

Fillets don't print good when coming off the bed, because they overhang and you cant use supports. Use a chamfer instead, the result will be clean and perfect.

Three points defines a plane while four is over constrained. This is the reason that most 3d printer designs use three bearings on X and Y axes instead of four.Interesting, I didn't have the problem. Did you put the little bushing underneath the arm?Cool idea, like an igus bearing!  How does it feel?

When I printed this out I noticed the same thing too and created a little bushing piece to fit on the under side of arm.

What is the bearing size used for this mod? 1+2 x 24mm ?What's the reason to have a shorter bearing on one side?Thanks for this, nice work. Unfortunately, it doesnt solve the problem of the original one for me, as the tiewraps still interfere with the sensor arm. Unless I loosen that arm but then it hits the base plate again. So I made a quick and dirty remix basically adding one printed bearing so I dont need tie wraps on the sensor arm side. This is a very nice mod! I'm sure this can be added to it: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4132041
I'm gonna try it asap! =PI've uploaded the bushing I used to solve the issue. I ""think"" its the right revision, please let me know if it doesn't fit!Im giving up on 3d printed bearings. They seem to work well for perpendicular / coaxial loads,  I can see them work quite well in a 3d printer,  but I dont think they are suitable for cantilevered loads, and thats basically what we are dealing with here. I read even ingus bearings are not very good at this, so I ordered some regular linear ball bearings.

Im still curious how you solved the sensor arm binding though.To be honest; its not good. The 3d printed bearing feels good, even great when you slide it over the bar.  Its feels better than my regular linear bearing. But once mounted its a different story. Either the bars are not 100% perfectly aligned or somehow my print isnt because its ok at full throttle but sticky at low throttle.  I filed the bearing out further and now it has enough play that if you apply a twisting force, it locks up badly. I need to go back to the drawing board."

I didn't edit the .stl you posted. I started fresh in Fusion360 to build the overall shape and then finished it off in TinkerCAD.Yeah, that's a wiring or solder problem. I once had a similar problem that took me over an hour of repeated testing to finally catch the (in retrospect) obvious mistake.  If you haven't already, double check the polarity of the diodes, preferably with a multimeter. Also, look for shorts to other lines. 
Good luck!

[ Still curious how you edited the original ]I used your firmware from Github in early Dec 2020 (F9 fix completed). For some reason on my top row (on DIO 9) the F5 and 8 work but the 6,7, 9, 0 and F9 don't. I think that I have all the soldering done correctly and with continuity. I am waiting for my brother to come by to assist. He knows about electronics! Cheers! Congratulations working through your CAD issues.  The design looks deceptively simple; but, in reality, is very complex.  Normally, I encourage people to use my Onshape CAD files even if they have to learn Onshape from scratch.  But, in this case, the original design is so complicated that is probably unreasonable.
If you didn't wire exactly the way I did, you would have to edit a table in my software a bit.  If you have any problems, contact me and I'll see if I can help.Thanks! Made a new shell .stl from scratch. Started in FreeCAD where I made a solid block in the shape I wanted. Gave up making it hollow in FreeCAD so I imported the shape into Tinkercad and worked from there. Firmware isn't up and running yet as I'm new to arduino and using this project to learn the basics. I'll be sure to grab the latest files. Nice!
Just curious, what firmware did you use?  If you used mine, note that there is a recent update to fix a problem with the way some games read the F9 key.
Also, did you edit the original stl, edit the CAD files, or start over.  Again, just curious."

Maybe do a version where the nameplate is blank, so we can emboss our own text there?

I wish someone would do something like this for the original DS...This looks great!  I saw another shell that was posted to Thingiverse that was split in two for easy printing. Then some simple glue to put it back together.  

https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4022775

Could you split it like that?  

Were you able to get your measurements down?Love the design. There’s a couple problems though. First off, it’s set to the dimensions 0.13 x 0.07 x 0.01 (in). When given the LWH that actually makes it fit a DS Lite, it’s revealed that the area where the screen sinks in needs a pretty drastic adjustment. In my measure, the screen needs to be able to sink in 2.5mm more than it does. The amount of adjustments I had to give it actually compromised the really cool v design around the Game Boy Macro Lite text.

If those were corrected, this would be without question the best Gameboy Macro faceplate on this website - bar none.That would be awesome. Could you upload the new versions? I'd love to try to print it off!I have a re-design ready to print. I also found some of my fit issues were from the replacement trigger button had some extra flashing on they. Once I cleaned them up it worked great. The other issues have been corrected in the model.

My current situation is I recent installed a BL touch, I an have trouble with finding my probe offset. In the trial and error process I destroyed my magnetic mat on my ender 3. I ordered a replacement put is kept sliding off the magnetic base (Lost a 11 hours print 7 hours in), so I ordered a second one and I could not remove prints from it. Now... [heavy sigh]... I am waiting on my Wham Bam base to come in and I am gonna dis-assembly the printer and perform maintenance on it while I wait for the new 

In Conclusion, I am waiting for part for my printer. However if someone would like to help me Prototype, I can upload the revised model. i have a 2 button and 4 button ready
Thank you for the feedback! Very glad to hear, and I will be keeping my eye out for progress on this.Thank you for the feedback. The DS I bought got delayed in the Mail, so I have not been able to perform a fit test. I will not these issues when I redesign the Prototype. Thanks again for the Feed back.

Please check your controller against the identifier list, to see which version is required for yours. There are 3 different variants, and they all have slightly different dimensions, making them (mostly) incompatible with one another.

<h5>v1 specifics</h5>
V1 originally came with a tiny little attachment that screws in to add a little joystick.
I added that in, mostly because it looks kinda cool, but like the original it doesn't play all that great tbh :P There is also a tiny lid included, so you can use it like a normal controller. This has a tiny sliver in there, which you can use a coin to screw/unscrew it in place with.

<h3>Printing</h3>
These require a SLA/Resin Printer to achieve the best results. There's fine details that get lost with FDM (and will hurt your fingers with extended play!).
I printed the one in the image on a basic/cheap Elegoo Mars (first, non-pro, model) so you dont need something super fancy. I did finish it with a layer of paint and lacquer from a spraycan to ensure longevity.

<p>These mounts are designed to work with the <a href=""https://www.adafruit.com/product/2167"">Adafruit 2167</a> 3mm beam break sensor or the <a href=""https://www.adafruit.com/product/2168"">Adafruit 2168</a> 5mm beam break sensor.</p>

<img src=""https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/310x233/2167-02.jpg"" />

<p>The two-wire module is the IR LED and the three-wire module is the sensor.</p>

<p>Red wires connect to operating voltage, either 5v or 3.3v.</p>

<p>Black wires connect to ground.</p>

<p>White wire connects to the input port.</p>
<p>- When the beam is un-broken, the white wire will be at a logic high level. (close to operating voltage)</p>
<p>- When the beam is broken, the white wire will be at a logic low level. (close to ground)</p>
 ------------
<p>Left and right mounts are mirror images of each other.</p>
<p>The LED and sensor modules will easily snap into either one.</p>
------------
<p>This particular set of mounts was designed for use in a skeeball game.</p>

<p>You can protect the sensors and wires from bouncing balls using <a href=""https://www.homedepot.com/p/Everbilt-1-2-in-W-x-1-2-in-H-x-96-in-L-Aluminum-C-Channel-with-1-16-in-Thick-802657/204273938"">1/2"" x 1/2"" C-channel aluminum</a>.</p>
<p> - The mounts fit inside the C-channel.</p>
<p> - Mount on the back of the playfield.</p>
<p> - Position so the mounts are parallel and the IR beam passes through the center of the target hole.</p>
<p> - Put the open side of the ""C"" toward the back of the playfield.</p>
<p> - Cut a notch in the side of the aluminum so the LED and sensor can see each other.</p>
------------
<p>For ease of maintenance, I suggest using #8-32 x 1"" machine screws and <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002KT11XO/"">#8-32 threaded inserts</a>.</p>

<p>The threaded inserts allow you to remove and replace the mount without stripping the screw holes.</p>

<p>This is especially important if you are working with Medium Density Fiberboard since screw threads break MDF down to pulp so easily.</p>
------------
<p>SCAD files included so you can easily modify the mounts to work with your project.</p>

What you'll need for 1 holder/mount:
2 magnets - each 2mm thick and 25mm to 35mm diameter, See image.
1 Spring coil - you can find these on ebay. See image.

Instructions:
1. Choose and print one of the models. I prefer version #2 because it's more lightweight.
2. Glue one magnet to the cap and the other magnet to the inside base of the cup.
3. Attach the coil to the ring on the cap.
4. Use 3M adhesive tape to mount it to the ceiling.

Now just slide your headset cable inside the ring/carabiner at the bottom of the coil and you will have tangled free VR experience!

If you make this, don't forget to share with us the final result!

Thingiverse is getting worse and worse by the day. Many features have been broken for ages, and MakerBot clearly doesn't care about fixing them. View counts don't work, editing model descriptions is a pain, and now my recent uploads from the past month aren't showing up in search results. I can't even see them in my profile. This website is broken and shows no sign of improving.

I've left up my Thingiverse posts, but have removed most of the STL files. You can [download my models](https://www.printables.com/social/318555-russell-wong/models) from Printables.com, and I'll get points to use toward Prusa filament. All of my future work will be available there.

#####Update

My strap locks worked really well, but were a pain to take off when I wanted to swap my controller grip for a golf adapter. Also, the TPU straps irritated my hands. I've replaced them with this:

[Oculus Quest 2 controller Pistol Grips with Velcro Straps
 on printables.com](https://www.printables.com/model/270762-oculus-quest-2-controller-pistol-grips-with-velcro)

--

This strap lock works with thatdude902's [knuckle-style TPU strap](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4625898) for the Oculus Quest 2 controllers. It enables you to quickly tighten or loosen the knuckle strap, and holds it in place while you're using the controllers.

The lock clips onto the wrist cord and holds the knuckle strap in place through friction. After you tighten it, you can slide the cord's plastic strap lock up against it to really lock everything in place. My strap lock's holes are further apart than the plastic lock's holes, so the cord gets pinched between them and won't move.

Please note that you should still wear the wrist cord around your wrist as a backup. This also makes it easy to tighten the knuckle strap, so it's both safer and more convenient.",,"['oculus', 'oculus_quest_2', 'quest_2']",1,64,93,0,0,0,Gadgets,video-games,

Many thanks go to them for creating the design and sharing it CC.

A number of small changes were necessary because I was using parts which had slightly different dimensions. Some ways it varies from the original design:

* Used with the 2-output GBS8200 marked ""HCKJ 8200 V5.1""
* Used with a QGeeM VGA-HDMI converter, leaving the USB-micro port on
* Adds more passive cooling to the converter which I found to generate significant heat
* Leaving the VGA output intact
* Single panel-mount RCA jacks for audio instead of a dual-jack module
* Leaving the arrow buttons in place (though they are not used)
* Reserves some additional space on the side of the GBS so you can use 90 degree header pins to affix the ESP8266 to the GBS board instead of a solder blob and still have space
* A USB-C power supply (optional)

Like the original design, the case is used for:

* A compact GBS-Control mod with Voultar's perpendicular mounting style
* An internalized HDMI output option
* Included stereo RCA jacks appropriate for a full component video hookup.

To learn more about this project, see the original design page, the GBS-Control github and wiki (https://github.com/ramapcsx2/gbs-control) and a build by Voultar (https://youtu.be/1AVXhiTlmgo).

These are STUPID basic and are missing the letters and also the little tabs that denote which lettered button goes in which slot cause all those are for is to denote which hole which goes into. I feel like if you can't work out which button is which normally then maybe you shouldn't be modifying your Joycons? LOL!

Anyway my recommendations when printing this... I went with:

Nozzle size: 0.4mm
Layer height: 0.1mm
Supports: Yes probably?
Adhesion: Skirt

*IMPORTANT* 
Your first layer squash is going to make or break this part! If you are too close the scale of the parts that actually push things is going to be WAY off and make the button not work properly! I also do not recommend rafting this part since it's so small. Unless you are very good at adjusting your raft air gap!

I'm recommending supports when printing in default orientation with the caution of there being a small stick inside the button to depress the actual button on the board inside the Joycon. This stick is PURPOSEFULLY A TINY AMOUNT SHORTER THAN THE OUTER PART OF THE BUTTON! If this stick is extended it will not function properly! To get around this little bit of weirdness which is a 3D printing only problem either print it upsidedown with the hole up (though this will mess with the look of the top of the button and may make it so you have to trim it some and/or the button will straight up be too short to push properly depending on how hard your squash is) or print it regular hole down with support but you will have to ensure you remove the small bit of support under the stick! 

I REPEAT THE STICK HAS TO BE ABOUT 1MM SHORTER THAN THE OUTSIDE OF THE BUTTON!

I was originally going to make an audio reflector in the hope of improving the bass, but then thought I'd try this instead. I made a model of the section of strap it attaches to using photogrammetry (RealityCapture) and did the rest in Fusion 360 and Blender. Prusaslicer complained of errors, but it fixed them and printed. I originally printed the audio funnel 06 file, but the quest_2_audio_funnel.stl has been edited a bit to tidy it up so I suggest trying that. Printing it with the front face of the clip section flat on the print bed worked best even though it needed more supports. With it printed at an angle, the clip dimensions were a little small.

Functionally, it greatly increases the volume of the Quest 2's audio output, not just the bass. Unfortunately this highlights a white noise/hiss in quiet environments. I'm going to try them a bit more in games and decide whether I keep using them or maybe just try making a reflector rather than a funnel.

--------------

Competition Pro joysticks from the eightys are known to be great and durable devices. Compared to their competitors they were great! However, they were by far not as good, as they could have been. The outside was perfect, but the problems are the inner parts of the device:The first and second generation of thise joysticks had a large rubber ring to return the stick into its center position. This ist not the best solution to the problem. Later versions featured a large spring to improve the situation. But still, the one thing that never changed, was the poor selection of switches: The producer not only decided to use microswitches with a very high trigger force, he also did not care much about what switches to install into his products. I have opened a lot of competition pro joysticks, and each had its own brand or type of microswitches inside...

So, being a nostalgic person with a 3D printer, I decided to create a mod for converting this wonderful joysticks to what they could have been in the first place: <b>The best digital Joysticks on earth</b>.

I shaved down the controller pieces from Sanlaki, but everything else is new to this design. 

I designed this print uses 24"" of 3/4"" PVC available at any local hardware store for easy sourcing. (1x8"", 1x16"")
I ordered and used the 60lb magnets from (https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07YSTJ4TR/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) along with the washers from the 100lb magnets from (https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XN6L65J/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).

Currently everything is pressure fit, so you may need to print at 101% or 102% depending on the tolerance of your printer. 
I am working on an adjustable stock option, but for now it's just the pressure fit version. 
The first of two washers will be screwed into the body, the second will be screwed into the piece named front grip. The screw for the front grip will have to be short enough to not protrude into the pipe. 
The front grip was made to be adjustable by sliding it along the pipe. With this setup, it is customizable from an smg to a sniper rifle. In theory, since it slides along the pipe, it should function as a pump shotgun as well.

Future improvements I have planned are to get the adjustable stock sorted out and a mounting point for a sling. 

NOTE: The photo provided is from an early version of the stock. The body is actually broken in this picture. Printed correctly, there will not be a gap between the body and the barrel. 
",,[],6,92,129,1,1,1,Gadgets,video-games,"Good Day! 

I DID play some Contractors with it yesterday and it DEFINITELY takes some getting used to. 
The first magazine is AWESOME. =D

The only thing that I need to rethink is the front mounting piece. What I thought of as a ""feature"" in it's movement, may actually be a flaw. 
Because it moves, it is impossible to develop any kind of muscle memory with it's location. 
I think printing it a lot tighter would be a benefit, but I might use the mounting screw to barely bite into the pvc, holding it more in place. 
This will be a personal preference however as each printer has a different tolerance level. 

Other than that, I am very happy with it as a first attempt at making a stock.

My thoughts on the magnets. I have 60lb on both the front and rear because they are flat mounted they seem to do the trick. 
The controller grips that I attached have been resized for the 60lb magnets. If you are going to use the 100lb, you will need to grab the original Sanlaki controllers and cut them down so the magnets can attach flat. Nice! Thanks a lot. Trying to understand how to get all the component as a Canadian gave me a headache. Ordered some Magnet 100lbs as 60 lbs seems inexistant. Will try with both 100lbs for front and rear oculus controller.

 Did you try it? Does the absence of a metal body and the need to put the controller in a precise spot is awkward?"

I put new Joysticks and a Retropie in it to play many different games.  Found out that many of the older games are much easier to play with a joystick restricted to just 4 directions rather than the 8 Way Joysticks installed.  I wanted an easy way to swap back and forth.  So I designed these inserts. They are just installed into the holes for the joysticks.  They stay put via friction.  I have had them in play for a couple weeks and they seem to stay put OK, but possibly may loosen their grip overtime.  Your mileage may vary.   The work for me and my scenario.   I have tried these in the TMNT game as well as the Final Fight cabinet.  I THINK they would work with any other standard A1UP cabinet, but no guarantees.

Added V2 which can be inserted and removed without removing the joystick top.

Added V3 which cuts the corners on the inside of the PLUS.  I find improves play on 4way sensitive games.

Also included is a holder that I stuck on the top of my cabinet to hold these when not in use.

This makes playing Donkey Kong, Dig Dug, Pac-Man, etc much easier and is easily removed when the restriction is not needed.

I'm trying to use this for an afterburner detent and I find that the 8x3mm magnets are very strong. Has anyone tried a small piece of metal instead of two magnents?
Originally I had the magnets attract but I found having them repulse each other might also work for an afterburner--how are other people setting this up?This! This is it! Works absolutely flawless and even fits 8x2mm magnets out of the box. I applied double-sided tape on the base and on the handle part and it works like a charm, could'nt recommend it more.

Special benefit to all internal solutions: If you switch between games that work just 100% thrusters and use a reverse butto (like Elite Dangerous) and something that changes from back to forth in the middle (like Mechwarrior 5), you'll definately want an external solution and nothing that requires you to unscrew that damn thing every time you change the game.

For those who have a Driving Force GT, you may be interested in this. It's quite common to upgrade the stock motor for a more powerful one, but it's a tricky process as you'll have to dremmel the new motor's shaft to be flat on one side so that it's a 'D' shape, just so you can use the original gear. If you dremmel/file it on an angle it can ruin the bearings, putting uneven stress on the motor as the gear wobbles. Ask me how I know.

This then is essentially a gear adapter that slips over the stock gear found on the more powerful aftermarket motor - an M36N-2 motor for example - so that it converts it into a Logitech gear. No more dremmeling the new motor's shaft to fit the original gear, this just slips over the new one to convert it back into a DFGT gear.

Instructions:

1. Purchase the new motor here (between 2-3 week delivery):

2. Purchase this 24v 6a power brick:
https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B093WNCD6S

3. Download and 3D print this new gear adapter.

4. Slide the adapter over the new motor's existing gear.

5. Remove the original DFGT motor and install the new motor (the positive and negative wires MUST be switched).

6. Re-assemble and use the new power brick. Done!

Was that something you had to do as well or did I miss something? I was thinking that with this 3d printed gear this motor would be a drop in replacement for wheel but I had to do a lot more work after purchasing everything. "

It's a simple Joy-Con holder so they don't knock around when in transit which prevents them from scratching each other or draining the battery.

Changes:
<ul>
<li>Adjusted the size of the rails so the Joy-Cons will have a looser fit</li>
<li>Made the case and rails a bit taller so I could include detents at the top of the Joy-Con rails that lock them in place using the Joy-Con latches. This might make it hard to unlock them if you have fat fingers, but it prevents them from sliding around when in storage (without needing to make the rails too tight).</li>
<li>Changed from disc magnets to 4mm cube magnets (I used Buckycubes)</li>
<li>Removed Switch logo because I was too lazy to move it up vertically so it would be centered</li>
</ul>

<li>joycon-case_bottom_taller-hole.stl: regular M3 nut (drop in after printing)</li>

For now, use the “Scale” tool into your slicer to scale to 10% of current size. The holes lined up perfectly on my print.

I’m guessing there is some change in defaults in one app versus the other, converting mm to cm. Hey, great design and just what I needed, but when I import it into the creality slicer, it's size is massive. Do you know what the dimensions are that it should be to print? I matched the length with the 3/8ths mic mount that this was remixed from, but the screw holes did not line up. Thanks!whats the correct size for the Ram_Mount_Stream_Deck_v3.stl file? when i open it, it's 1690mm (X) x 410mm (Y) x 377mm (Z)."

A) A mounting bracket that ensures that the micro USB and HDMI ports on the Pi 3 line up as close as possible to the existing holes on the back of the clone case. UPDATED - Pi Mount V2 uploaded which has more material surrounding the screw holes.

B) A mounting bracket for locating 2 momentary push button switches so that the reset and on/off buttons on the clone case are fully functional.

For info on how to wire the switches and install the necessary script take a look at ElTacoLoco's excellent Thing. https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2011955

C) A plate that can be used to mount 2 x USB sockets so that you can use USB controllers instead of the 9 pin connectors that these clones come supplied with. You will need to buy 2 x 90 degree USB extension cables for this purpose.

My part mounts a hard drive under the USBGDROM, and I have inserts to fill in the drive opening.

It would be great if both designs can be merged for a complete solution :)Superb fit and finish with the USB-GDROM drive.  I left the screws that hold the drive to the mount slightly loose in order to compensate for a small offset to the drive connector in my personal Dreamcast.  There's minimal wobble, and the result looks absolutely professional.

The modified drive bay insert completes the package.  When combined with this drive mount, it will save some material in comparison to the previous revision with a printed bottom.

the stl files load so small because they are loading in mm using the correct size value in inches. use bing or google to convert that value to mm and use that value as your size value. hopefully this helps."

I found one that came close, Gadjet's 'Retroid Pocket 2 Case Slim'. This seems to be the best intersection of protection and ergonomic grip while still being slim enough for pocket use. I felt it needed improvements, so I made the following changes.

* The original case won't snap onto the device correctly. When on the back, it collides with the trigger buttons. On the front, it collides with the Y and right direction buttons. Two things to fix this. First, I cut off the corners. Second, I widened the grips.

* I raised the grip, so that there is more flat surface at the bottom. I did this for improved ergonomics. The way I hold the RP2+, in a way that I can access the shoulder buttons, is I rest my pinkies on the bottom of the unit, and my ring and middle fingers griping the grips.

* I removed the branding, wasn't to my liking.

* Included both a plain option, and a Zelda triforce design, with an additional model for inserts. 

1/17/22 - I've updated the design with grips on the side, inspired by PSP and Vita. I believe this goes a long way in making this much more comfortable to use. I've also generally cleaned up the model and smoothed out some edges. I think I can now consider this design finished.

This thumbstick extender is used to clip onto the controllers thumbstick to give more accurate control when aiming in a video game (i.e. sighting in Fortnite). With the greater amount of travel due to stick length, you get far more precise movements in game (avoiding spinning your crosshairs back and forth past enemies in the heat of battle).

I made this as controlling the aim in Fortnite is a nightmare due to the short travel on the thumbstick.

I have put 'maybe' XBOX controller compatible as the Gioteck controller I have based this on is an XBOX controller replica (but I cannot guarantee fitment as I do not have an XBOX controller to test with). This may be for use with other replica controllers also (but again, no guarantees).

See printer settings for assembly then just clip 2 of the bottom pieces over one side of the thumbstick and pull across to secure the third bottom piece. You can use the end of a key to coax the last piece outwards if necessary.

These will work if the rubber material is completely removed from the PS4 controller analog sticks. I used a pair of tweezers to ensure all pieces had been removed prior to installation. 

**Types:**
I designed several variants of controllers I had lying around so my friend could decide which one he liked the best. Here are the files with brief descriptions:
**1. PS4 Grip** - First iteration I made. Similar to newer Xbox controllers but with a near 90 degree side that some may find uncomfortable.
**2. Round Thin** - Measured to be the most accurate representation of a stock PS4 analog stick.
**3. Round** - Taller version of the standard PS4 analog stick
**4. Wavebird** - Based off the Round Thin model, but with added concentric rings like the popular Nintendo Wavebird controller
**5. Xbox Style 1** - Similar to the original Xbox ""beach ball"" controller left stick.
**6. Xbox Style 2** - Similar to the original Xbox ""beach ball"" controller right stick.
**7. Nintendo Switch** - Based off the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller 

I may add more designs in the future!",,"['analog_stick', 'controller_grip', 'dualshock_4', 'playstation', 'playstation_4', 'ps4', 'sony_ps4']",7,712,88,0,1,1,Gadgets,video-games,"Fof 8bitdo SN30 Pro these must be scaled at 93 for X, Y and 100 for Z.
The Nintendo Switch model fits perfectly and works like a charm, printed with PLA, no need for TPU. Very comfortable.
Flood the sides in some flexible contact adhesive to make sure these never jump off, as the shape of the support just can't grip them very well. After it's dry good luck removing them! It still can be done, but probably by ripping the grip again.

I think the glue part is necessary on TPU also as the grip is not following the contour of the thumbstick under the cap, so probably they will jump off afer the first vigorous push. I'm thinking that Silicone would be a safe bet as it doesn't attack the plastic.

Still surprised this isn't a more popular object, as it's such a simple and quick fix."

I printed the original magnetic version and my magnets didn't fit, so I was about to do the same thing and add a peg. Luckily, I found your work, first.

The only thing I'd change is to leave the frame fully encircling the lens near the nose, so that it would be easier to take the lens out without touching it. I'm guessing you cut it away to give more room for noses.

EDIT: I may have spoke too soon. My lenses are REALLY close to the Quest 2's lenses, so I've done my own remix of a remix that added more space between the lenses. lensholder_RH_base_V15:  object invalidly defined when using XYZMaker... Thanks for this remix. I have the original V2 and find that the tabs that jut out near the bridge of the nose will jab into my nose sometimes. I think I'll try this one.

Just to confirm, you need to remove the plastic ring around the lens and replace it with these, correct?Thanks, you were right, I'd eventually figured that out. Cheers, still works great!I think you might have them on the wrong eyes, the parts that jut out near the nose should actually jut out near the top of the lens :) But if you put the rings on opposite lenses, then they stick out near your nose (and really hurt!)."

The case itself uses a screwless design. The front cover can be printed without support but you'll need it for the back.

The front comes in two flavors. One has holes to show the LEDs when using an opaque plastic and one with none for transparent and semi transparent plastics. You'd be amazed on how most light colored plastics will show the LED light through.

The back cover comes in two flavors as well. One is plain and the other has cafealpha's cow mascot. Personally I think you print the one with the cow xD.

I made it to play the game VTOLVR on the oculus rift CV1. The **RIGHT oculus touch controler** fits in it. Tension in the joystick gimbal is made by using 4 small rubberbands. (I recommand hair tie for that as it is easy to find and should be about the right size).

I have uploaded many STLs as I made diferrents variations on the design, but you will need only 2 or 3 parts. I personally use grip-long.stl + armchair3-A.stl + armchair3-B.stl as seen in the first picture.

First choose a grip, the part that will be in your hand :
- grip-short.stl
- grip-long.stl
(The long one is probably better for most cases)

Then you must choose a base :
- base-with-screws.stl can be screwed on a support.
- base-with-hooks.stl can be rubberbanded around something, as shown on my leg in the image.
- base-with-buckles.stl is meant to be used with velcro straps
- base-armchair.stl is meant to be fixed on a chair-arm with a pair of colson cable clamp.
- base-armchair2 is in two parts (A and B) and is also meant to be colson cable clamped on a chair arm. It was broken in two part to be able to print it without making too much supports.The two parts are assembled as a simple tight fit.
- base-armchair3 is also in two parts A and B. part B should be screwed on your chair arm (with a M5 screw, and an hexagonal nut). Then part A will clip into part B, which means you can quickly install or remove the jostick grip which is tied with part A, at will. Part B would remain in place on the chair arm definitivly. This is pratical if you want to be able to instal/remove the joytick grip between playing sessions, so that the chair arms goes under your desk.
- base-armchair4-B.stl is another version similar to base-armchair3-B.stl but for an armchair that has less angle. It should be associated with base-armchair3-A.stl.

Warning : all the armchair files where attempts to design something from my own chairs. No guarantee it will fit your chairs!

The screwed bases will be better, strapping the base on your leg may be a portable solution, but it is a soft surface. A strong immobile fixation is preferable.

Some stl files contains small support shapes that are meant to be broken after printing.

Then I found [CyberDNIWE's model](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4893045), with its tightened fittings, and modified it to use the same octagonal gate shape as S_R_Design's, because my stick has a stock actuator. The tightened fittings on the guiding poles/holes were great and eliminated all wobble after install, but the allowances around the clips were far too low for my stick: I had trouble fitting it on, and it did not snap on without a significant amount of sanding.

after all bad player always blames the tools :D
thanks!Following up on the diagonals question: I did some specific testing of this last night, watching the registered inputs as I moved the stick around to look for any potential for missing inputs. I found that diagonals are registered somewhere around 60-70% of the stick's travel, allowing plenty of wiggle room for activation. No missed inputs on my end, except for those caused by my own poor performance lolNo issues hitting diagonals so far, though I've only tested it for an hour or so of Guilty Gear play. I'll revisit this post if it pops up.

But yeah, I'd guess the difference in printer, material and print settings are the cause of the inconsistency with the snaps. Your post mentioned having elephant's foot issues, but I haven't encountered anything like that when printing my prototypes. Maybe that's the reason the stock octagon missed diagonals for you too?

Either way, thanks for the work you did tightening the guides! This was my first time working with CAD and it was super helpful having a base that solved half my problems right off the bat!

Cheers!Hello, thanks for pointing out the clip tolerance problem. On my JLF-knockoff you do need to press the gate a little to make them snap. I assume the differences between click and no click are so small that on some printing settings it goes well while on others it doesn't.

I've actually tried originally S_R_Design's gate with a stock actuator, but found out that I occasionally miss diagonals with it.
Have you noticed anything like that with your version?"

Requires disassembly of both your elite strap and the bobo vr m2 straps.

On BoboVR M2:
Remove the back strap from the front assembly on bobo vr by unscrewing the screws on the inside of the ring, then using a flathead screwdriver push pull the button piece off the outside, and after that push in the 3 snap-fit tabs to release.

On Elite strap:
get a small flathead under the outer rubberized black layer (be careful not to get under the middle one) and pry open. It is a snap-fit plus some adhesive tape inside.

next remove the screws holding the interior black hard plastic shell to the white outer assembly (screw length from left to right = Medium, Small, Large, Small, Large, Small, Medium). Lastly, on the top and bottom edges, push in toward the center on the black piece and remove the snap-fit there. you should then be able to lift it off (if you have the battery version, do this CAREFULLY and make sure you're not pulling the whole battery internals up as well).

Now the prep work is done, get a heat gun or hair dryer and gently soften the printed arms to match the curve of the elite straps, then reassemble.

The ratchet teeth for this will work as a platform for the elite strap assembly, meaning this could be modified to replace the normal elite strap arms entirely as well (the ones that crack)",,[],2,130,34,1,0,2,Gadgets,video-games,"sure thing, I'd recommend taking a look at V2 as well, it's a bit better and you can customize the angle of the elite strap.

Enjoy!Hey Ken, I made newer versions but Thingiverse doesn't let me upload them for some reasonI made a 200mm tilted version but Thingiverse deosn't let me upload it i don't know why. Alos, I'm not sure how that version would hold up due to the layer position relative to the thread.Hi and thanks for your files! I've printed the 20cm one and it works great!
Could I kindly ask if you can make a 17cm version with the head angled 15° FORWARD? Thanks in advance and happy new year!These extensions work great, love the free moving lock down nut at the base too.  The 20cm extension works great with the Warthog however the other two don't only because the thread section is too short.  If you could redesign the two shorter ones with the same length thread as the 20cm extension they would perfectly fit both Virpil and Thrustmaster Warthog sticks.  I own the Virpil Mongoose, the TM Warthog and FA18 stick.

It's a remix of a remix!

I printed the [Better Oculus Quest 2 Magnetic Lens Adapter](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4781759) by HaroldHyrax, but the magnets I have didn't fit well. Rather than resizing the holes, I decided to add a peg to the base that slides into the hole in the top piece.

Then I found a remix by [seethebridges](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4630689) that does exactly what I was thinking. However, that was based on the [original version](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3659124) by jegstad, and my [Zenni](https://ca.zennioptical.com/p/metal-alloy-full-rim-frame-with-spring-hinges/5500?skuId=550021) lenses (-2.50 and 1.57 mid-index) were just about touching the Quest 2 lenses. Also, I didn't like that the top piece was only 3/4 of a circle (I assume to make more room for noses). It's fine when the lenses are in the Quest 2, but they're less protected when sitting on the table.

So, I went back to HaroldHyrax's version and added a bevelled 5mm peg, with a corresponding 5.2mm hole in the top piece. Lots of space for thicker lenses, and no need for magnets. As with the original versions, you'll need to use the glasses adapter for your Quest 2.

Now I just need a case to hold the lenses when I take them out. Time to start looking for a box that I can remix!",,"['oculus', 'oculus_quest_2', 'quest_2']",4,171,123,0,0,0,Gadgets,video-games,

Instead of having loose carts shoved in a box or filed away in a binder, I wanted to have the carts on display, and the more carts I obtain, I would like to add to the display. So I took the chance to design a modular display with a window. The display vault is designed to prevent the cart falling out of the interior bezel, in-between the acetate window and the vault, and should slot back into positon when rotated; and sits on the notches of the cart, not the contacts.

Other vaults will be able to join together with the tessellating ""teeth"", and I also made borders to finish the set, as it were.

Total print time was 4 hours in one piece with a preliminary bed to help with adhesion, no supports were needed at all due to the flat level, resolution at 0.1313mm, nozzle @210C and bed at 60C using PrimaValue PLA. Cutting the acetate was a bit dodgy and too thick, hence the small cracks during cutting but I will be using thinner acetate in later iterations.

Borders are also included in this download to close off a row/column. ""Closed"" borders are to stop a row/column from proceeding, if this make sense.

Your printed version looks longer to accommodate the actual PCB vs what the STL would.Yes, was just thinking where do I even start modelling this. Looks fantastic, must print it when I get my switch.Never took it as an accusation or anything. Quite the opposite. So there are different Versions out there, you say in your built you needed exactly 10mm more? Maybe I should include a lengthened version.That's weird. The printed example appears more rectangular than the STL, though that could be in part due to the angle. 

The reason why I wonder if our PCBs are different is because the screw holes from front to back are ~10mm shorter than the holes on my board. The springs on my input switches bottom out before the SCART ports line up.

I wasn't accusing you of anything, by the way. I was just bewildered by why it wouldn't fit. I can't see what you say you see in the images, but I can assure you that the printed version is exactly the stl in the files. It's a snug (but in no way tight) fit and you have to desolder the extra output terminals (as stated in the description) to make it fit height-wise, but my Otaku switch did fit like a glove."

This is my second take on the all mighty Hitbox♥™
however this time it comes with a twist. 
I cut in 2 extra slots for additional direction buttons so the cheating is even more apparent and easier then ever smile smile :)

- - - DISCLAIMER WORK IN PROGRESS - - -
THIS IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS ALSO I DONT TRUST THE TOP PART TO BE MADE FROM A 3D PRINTER I PERSONALLY  AM GOING TO USE WOOD OR ALUMINUM - I'LL UPDATE THE FOTOS SECTION ONCE I CAN SHOW IT!! 

I tested the buttonslayout thoroughly and made a special layout which felt the most comfortable for me personally. It is kind of a classical Taito Vewlix Shoryuken layout but the far right buttons are placed differently. It might look weird at first glance but I had good results with this design. 

- Left hand is movement just like you know it from the original Hitbox. With a few small adjustments. 

- Make sure to  - - Print out the PDF-File of the butonslayout and have a look at it yourself
To test the button layout I put in a PDF in the files named ""Stoner's Buttonlayout for the Cheatbox )

-  print this PDF out and simply put it on a book or something thats about 4-5 cm in height and emulate it in your mind. 

- The button layout fits perfectly on a DIN A4 Paper ( for all the non german people here it's 	210 x 297 mm  (or in inches 8.2 x 11.6) sized paper.

--------------
Moving on, 
right hand is for  L1,L2,A,B,X,Y,R1,R2 etc. buttons
I put the R1 and R2 buttons on a diffrent position because I often have trouble pushing them in clutch situations
On the original Taito Vewlix button layout I don't really like where the R1,R2 buttons lie
so I put them up.


-------
Bottom Part:
 
 - The main connection to your Game consol or PC is going to 
go trough a ""Neutrik NAUSB-W""  USB-A to USB-B clutch.
Some friendly people from the ""TEKKEN Zaibatsu Discord Server"" brought to my attention that my previously desined Hitbox had a huge flaw.
When someone were to pull on the cable - the whole pbc would fall apart and you would be in deep shit. So yeah. No chance that can happen now!

- You will need to buy an ""Neutrik NAUSB-W"" from Amazon for 5 bucks or so and trust me. It's well worth the investment. 

- Also you will need to buy one USB-A to USB-b cable. However dont buy one thats longer than 3meters since they lose a lot of data transmission speed when they get longer than 3 meters. For USB 2.0 and 3.0 you want them to be 3 meter or shorter.

 For USB 3.1 you want your cable to be shorter than 1 meter even. If not why are you using USB 3.1
--------
Next to the Neutrik NAUSB-W slot I also put in aditional 24mm holes. you can Use these for L3,L3,Turbo,GameMode,swtich between X and Direct - input buttons or whatever. :D

In case you need further customization I put in the Fusion360 Original file in which I used to design this whole thing. Fusion360 is a free 2d designing programm for hobbyists :P

------
On your lefthand side you have 2 more buttons. My intention was to use these two for Start and Select
------

 The bottom and top part of my Hitbox has 30mm deep, 5mm wide in diameter holes in them. You can use these 5mm holes to  make M6 Screw slots. You need to use a M6 
thread cutter with the 5mm hole and you are in business! :D smile

New features:
- Button System for L2 and R2
- Attach hook for installing a Clip accesory, for attaching some accesory under the device (HUB USB, etc)

The L2 and R2 system originally was designed for displacement of these buttons on the device. Now, using a natural position of the hand, you can use these buttons with the mid finger, and free your index fingers for use L1 and R1 in a natural way, similar to a standard gamepad.

I will work on some piece for giving more comfortable L1 and R1 (biggest buttons), but for now, this solution is a good alternative, and within the X360 mods i published, the grip is so much comfortable.

I included this version, that basically is the dock within a minimal grip (rounded borders) without rail for installing other modules.

https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2892045the file for these are great but i cannot find a file for the triggers anywhere? are the specific grips you used or a file somewhere i have missed?
thanks I really appreciate your reply. I already figured it out. Thank you for taking the time to make designs for the gpd win 2.Dear DeenOx:

I am trying to 3d print your evo gpd win 2 design on i.materialise.com but it ask me if it is made in mm or inches and what scale it is made. How should i respond? Would you like to recommend an online 3d printing service? Or could you print your design and sell it to me. Thank you for taking the time to respond.Which hub did you buy that fits in this awesome design?Hi - i also sent a version of CFDMP_MGRIP_WIN2_EVO_V2.01.2.stl to 3dhubs for printing, and it was too big for my Win2.

The switch comfort grips that were printed also didnt slide onto the grip very easily. I don't know if this was due to the size issue, or just bad quality printing from the provider!

I've ordered a print of MGRIP_GPD-WIN2_BASE_V2.03.stl - the original grip - will see if there are any issues with that.I don't have any problem with the dimensions, my win2 fit in the dock grip perfectly Here's an image of the gap. In fact I am noticing that the other WIN-2 grip you posted that I printed yesterday is also bigger than the device. Did you perhaps model these grips off of a ptotoype WIN 2 that may have been a difference size than the final release retail version? Just finished printing and notice that it's slightly too big for the WIN-2. My device is able to slide left and right in the grip. The grip appears to be 1 or 2 mm too wide. Thank you so much for your excellent work! Perfect dock grip for the GPD Win2. I made it whit de clip and buttons and Xbox 360 grip. I do little mod for the buttons with springs. Thanks for your work Deen0X I dont know about anyone else but it is showing up as way too big in slic3r for my prusa mk3. What dimensions should it be?hi. the measures are in mm.
about sites, sorry but i don´t know any printing service to recommend. my recommendation for everyone is to buy a printer 3D, because printing services are so expensive and, with 3 o 4 jobs, you can buy a printer with a good quality, such Ender 3, to print your own stuff.
sorry if i can´t help to you with more info.nice!
hope you enjoy and found useful! :DHey - so i had this reprinted and now it all works perfectly! It didn't cost that much in the end £13 with a voucher!

Thanks very much man.hi.
the grips must slide with some resistance, but not so much. i designed these parts to be ""not easy"" to get away from the dock, so a little strenght you must apply for installing (but not so much)

take note that the dock was designed to be printed in vertical (the same for the grips). if you print in horizontal, the rails will be faulty.

I will update the EVO with a new version. some minor improvements.
I think i will publish at the end of the week.

And... i recommend to you to buy a printer. I saw prices for the grips and are so expensives, and for sure a printer is a very useful stuff for your home.  ;)I appreciate your communication and that you will look into it. Here are two more photos. I am holding the WIN 2 as tight to the left of the dock as possible. And you can see how much of a space there is on the right side. I feel as though the dock should ""snap"" tightly on to the WIN 2 but instead it is loose enough to fall off easily. Please check if the dimensions of the WIN 2 retail version differ from your prototype. Weird.
There are others users that printed this dock and they don't mention this issue.
In a well about I will get on my computer again and will check this

Sorry for the inconvenient.Hi.
Thanks for the comment
you right. i posted without re-scale the model. I usually work on 10X scale for small details on the model.
I fixed the files. now both are right scaled."

I have yet to print and test these models as the project is still in the design phase. Also included a model of the NES cart I made to check clearances.

So I'll admit I've been terrible about finishing projects. When I started college I told myself that I would put my larger projects on hold till I graduated. Then when I started grad school I did the same. Now most of those projects are sitting in a box collecting dust and I feel really bad that they never got to see their full potential. So I'm now going back and doing these projects justice.

I've collected the ashes of the Nintoaster project based around the NES side of the retro duo that I barely started before it was canned. It will be reborn into a more useful micro portable (no LCD but AV out) battery powered (with built in remaining capacity meter) NES that I can easily thow in a bag, take anywhere, and hook up to a pico projector for anywhere gaming. Because of this newfound life I will be dubbing this project NES Micro!

In this video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br5apIuwg6k) I show the pcb as it was before I stopped working on it and explain the concept and case design for the NES Micro. I'm really feeling this project so I even went as far as to do a super accurate model of the NES cart to check clearances. In the next video I'll 3D print the parts, start assembly, and design the electronics/firmware for the power and battery meter portions.

New Module for MGRIP project

This time i get some inspiration on X360 shape for creating a grip. This is not a full factor form, simply i take the horns of the original X360 gamepad and tried to do some similar in shape and form, but considering the features and behaviors of each device where i can use it (Win1&2 and XD).

The grip can be used with WIN1, WIN2 and XD. For WIN1 i design the shape form for allow to hot air flow away from the ventilator of the device.

This grip can be used alone, o with some top part of other grips i designed.

A, B and C type basicaly are different sizes.

The grip redirects the air flow and audio output to the top.

Nuevo módulo para el proyecto MGRIP

Para este grip me he inspirado en la forma general de un mando de X360. Este no es un grip que tome completamente la forma de un mando original de X360, sino que he tomado algunas características como los tamaños, formas generales, etc, y he creado algo parecido, tomando en cuenta las características de cada consola donde se utilizará este grip (Win1, Win2 y XD). Por este motivo realmente no es tan parecido al mando original, pero a la hora de utilizarlo es mucho mas cómodo.

El grip puede ser utilizado con las consolas WIN1, WIN2 y XD. Para la WIN1, he modificado la forma original para dar espacio a la salida de aire caliente del ventilador.

Este grip puede ser utilizado solo, o con alguna pieza complementaria superior de los otros grips que he diseñado.

Los tipo A, B y C son basicamente distintos tamaños del grip.

El grip redirecciona la salida de audio y entrada de aire de la WIN1 hacia arriba.

Espero lo encuentres útil y sobre todo cómodo.

This is the best option for when you need data from the LEAP, but want the user to still look forward through the Oculus. The difference between perceived and actual viewpoints between the Oculus and LEP with this is quite high in respect to both position and orientation, so it is recommended that you do not feed the LEAP's view directly into the Oculus' display, as it will cause some visual discomfort for the user.

Additionally, this is all one single piece, rather than 2 separate, and it's native orientation, while it will take longer to print, makes for a stronger, and more flexible piece. Raft and supports are recommended.  

Final design by Chris Harrison of [Ball State University's IDIA Lab.](http://idialab.org/)","Use both raft and support options, and print in the orientation as it stands now. It takes longer than it would when laying it flat, but the ""grain"" of the plastic will result in a much stronger, cleaner piece.  

You will almost definitely have to do some manual cleanup around the pegs and snaps with a sharp knife to get the piece to fit snuggly onto the Oculus. If it doesn't fit in, just keep shaving away until it does fit.","['leapmotion', 'oculus']",1,532,1181,0,0,1,Gadgets,video-games,Some funny holes in the mesh.

There are several PS4 cover projects on Thingiverse for the original PS4, but they are missing features, and some has wildly inaccurate dimensions.

File is provided for Right-hand sword handle.
Use slicer to mirror file to create left-hand sword handle.


**Required Hardware**
--------------------
It requires the following hardware for a PAIR of handles
- 8x [#6 x 3/8""] wood or sheet metal screws
- 2x [#6 x 1/2""] wood or sheet metal screws.
- 4x lengths of wire or string, approx 8 inches each.
- 2x 1/2"" wooden dowel, cut to 21 inches (or shorten to taste. suggestion: for 21"" dowel for a 5'10"" individual.)... minimum of 5.5"". Note that shorter=less swordfeel.
- length of rope approx 5mm or 0.2"" diameter for safety strap (optional but recommended)


**fast removal/addition**
------------------
Once assembled (see assembly instructions), the bottom part can be quickly removed by loosening the two screws that hold the top half to the dowel. The dowel is slid out, leaving a controller with just the top half still attached (options button still accessible).



**disclaimer**
--------------
Use at your own risk. Designer is not liable for damages resulting in the failure of this design. Vive Controllers are ~$200 at time of writing.

If you feel any ""wobble"" during use, stop immediately and check connections.. I also recommend use of safety straps (I use them), though they are technically optional.


**known issues/shortcomings**
----------------
- The long #6 screw was supposed to be a swivel point to scissor the top halves apart to close onto the handle during assembly... this doesn't work because i'm overlooked some stupid stuff. thus we need to flex them a little.
- Wires are added as secondary protection, Ideally, the top parts would be rigid enough to hold the vive controller (and prevent it from sliding up through the top half) with 100% certainty instead of 98% certainty... Or this would have some printed ""arms"" that go around the UFO, connecting top and bottom parts of the upper half... for now, there are wires.
- safety strap can also be threaded through controller's UFO, but risks interfering with tracking if it covers up one of those sensors. A better option would be a safety-strap guide that allows threading through UFO while making sure the safety strap Doesn't cover up any sensors.



**Assembly Instructions**
Step 1
-------------------
- Insert dowel into large hole in handle piece.
- secure using two of the #6 x 3/8"", screw in all the way so the tips dig into the wood.
- Wiggle and pull to ascertain that it is super secure.

Step 2
-----------------------
- Combine the two top-pieces. The side that frames the ""options"" button and vive trackpad goes on top.
- Place the #6 x 1/2"" screw through the side hole that isn't the dowel hole. (see image). 
- Screw together two pieces, minimizing gap between the two.
- Place this onto the Vive Controller. Be careful, some minor flexing is needed.

Step 3
-------------------
- Place Vive Controller into handle while threading the dowel through the dowel-hole of both top pieces.
- Controller should seat fully in the handle... Menu button goes on the side with the corresponding hole for it on the handle.
- Screw in two #6 x 3/8"" screws into the holes of top parts along outer edge of dowel-hole.
- These screws should dig into the wood to secure the top part on the dowel.

Step 4
--------------------------
- Thread wires through the wire-holes, through the controller UFO hole, and tie tightly. this ensures that the controller is affixed tightly to the top piece, making the situation of ""top piece flexes and controller slips through"" impossible.

Step 5
------------------------
- attach rope loop in safety strap attachment gap... Tie to wrist, freely enough that you can still twirl the sword, but not so loose that the extra rope gets tangled in the twirl.

Step 6
---------------------
- repeat with other handle.

I designed this to be able to mount a silent 120mm fan to cool my ps2. The small fan in the back had slowly gotten louder and louder, and a proper silent solution was not available in that size. 

Included are three files. One that has the ps2 grill going around all sizes, one that has it on the front and right (matching the console), and the third is a cutting/drilling guide as this will require some case modification. The cutting guide has the front top labeled to help get the orientation correct.

The fan that I used is a Noctua NF-P12 redux-900. Sitting about two feet away from the console it is essentially silent. This fan is a 12v fan though, and will require you to cut it's end off and solder directly to 12v on the power board. Doing this will mean that the fan is running as long as the power switch is on in the back, but with it being so silent, that is not a big deal.

Rubber band to hold the battery to the battery mount, it's actually pretty secure. 

Velcro to hold the mount on. I used white velcro as you can see in the picture and looped it through.

I have done my best to recreate a set of parts that can be assembled exactly as they are in game.

MCV stands for modular crossout vehicles, If you like this please give it a like, and leave a comment about what kind of stuff you might want in a future pack.

I started this project a few weeks ago, and I have spent many hours creating this design and refining it for 3d printing. Spider is a common nickname for legged builds in Crossout. This pack includes the Steppe Spider cabin and the ML-200 leg.

Assembly of ML-200:
Print one of each piece in the ML-200 folder. Dry fit all of the pieces together and sand any imperfections that hinder/harm the joints. Use dabs of hot glue inside of all of the peg holes to fasten the pieces together, but be sure not to put too much in because then it will overflow when you stick the peg in. I tried super glue but it didn't really bond to the plastic that well.

In order to build an entire vehicle you will need pegs and other pieces from this design: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3937871

I printed all pieces without supports. They are not very detailed to keep the prints simple and not print with supports.

They were created by C_Geremy. I just uploaded them, with permission, from a different site to here so that they are more easily accessible. 

I did make the 1x4x4 armor piece that the gun can fit on though. You can mount the gun anywhere but since the hole is in the very middle of the gun it causes it to be off by half of a centimeter, so the new armor piece solves that problem because the hole is also in the middle.

The files contained in this document are parts made to replicate the ""Pick Mug"" from the video game Deep Rock Galactic.  
The entire mug was made using my hand for scale to make the handle and all other parts were scaled using the handle as a reference.  
This took several hours of standing in the Abyss Bar staring at the mug and many barley bulbs to complete.  
The two drawing files (converted to JPEG for ease of viewing without SolidWorks) are to help in deciphering the what, where, and how many of every part, 
as well as giving an idea of how big the mug truly is.  As per the note on the Overall Dimensions file, the parts will most likely have to be sanded to 
get everything to fit together properly, because all but the Emblem Border Mount is sized exactly for ease of designing.  A good way of assembling this to
ensure it goes smoothly is to assemble the handle (the pick) and the mug separately, and then sliding them together.

Provided are space sim (center detent) and fighter jet (idle and afterburner detents) tracks, but you can use the Fusion360 file to create whatever detent you desire. The CAD file should have ""upper"" and ""lower"" decks; all you need to do is add a line between them and a ramp of sorts.

The tracks are inserted onto the throttle by replacing the middle screws of the cover with slightly longer screws.

The throttle arms have a body that houses a ball spring. I used M5x16 ball springs (specifically Amazon item # B07TD7M2FF), so you'll need to adjust the threading in the body if you choose a different ball spring. The bodies just snap onto the throttle arms (you'll need to disconnect the lock to separate the two half-throttles in order to attach the ball spring bodies).

I've used this in DCS quite a few times and loved them. There's some slight wear with PLA, but replacements are easy to make if it actually breaks the detent/bump. 

The original idea was to cut slits into the base piece, form metal tracks by hand filing aluminum sheets, and be able to hot swap the track without unscrewing anything; but I never got that far.

Since the tiny screw is also hard to apply, I choose to drill a hole above the Playstation and designed a hook for gabbing the console at the top. So there is no tilting possible anymore.

This top mount should work with all sorts of wall mounts. However you may need to adjust the spacing between the wall and the console using the included FreeCAD source file.

You need an up to date version of real thunders FreeCAD branch to use the file. Please dont judge the quality of the FreeCAD model. I hacked it in 5 minutes to secure the already mounted console, so I did not create a proper spreadsheet like in my other  designs.

These are made to thread into the back of the joycons for a secure fit. The stock joycon screws are too short so you will need to find some different screws for this to work. I believe the stock screws are 1.4mmx6mm. I haven't got the proper screws myself, I'm using some 2mm hex screws out of a kit that I bought recently which I wouldn't recommend as they are likely split or snap the screw posts on the joycon shell but it is possible to make them work if you're in a pinch. Whatever screws you use I would recommend making sure that the counter sunk holes of the grips are larger than the screw head you're using so you dont strip threads trying to get them in there. I edited these before submitting and increased the counter sink holes to 4mm so shouldn't be too much of an issue now.

For now there are just three screw holes since I was worried that adding one near the release button would weaken that piece too much but they're still pretty solid even with my mostly stripped joycon shells. It could probably be made to work with smaller screws but at the time I was still pretty new to modeling and 3d printing in general and just used what I had. I may revisit it soon to try to improve things. 

I used a set of calipers to take measurements and printed some gauges to figure out the curves and while everything fits really well, you may need to file/shave a little bit. If you're having issues with a gap near the release button, check to make sure the button is lined up with the hole before you tighten the screws.  I have also included a release peg to detach the joycons which you can cut to length. One other area I had issues with was under the ZL/ZR buttons but the models should have been edited to fix that. 

There are three different sizes included. So far I like the large one the best. Seems pretty comfortable, though maybe a little too thick near the bottom.

Supports
------------

Fasteners
-------------

-First is to prevent the weight of the cables from pulling on the Vive breakout box during gameplay causing them to loosen up.
-Second, in case someone trips over the wires or swings their arms into them, the tab will take the brunt of the force, not the cables.  If anything breaks, it will be the cable tie or the tab and not the breakout box.

### [N64D2WiiComp](https://github.com/jeffqchen/N64D2WiiComp)

------

This adapter allows you to plug a Wii video cable into the AV Multi port into an Nintendo 64. The primary purpose is to allow the use of Wii component video cable on Nintendo 64 consoles modded with N64Digital and UltraHDMI in YUV mode.

Part
-----------
SNES Video Plug
- https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000049107078.html

PCB
- Main: https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/ULsxf6av
- Sub: https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/Sx7UN638

Screw and nut
- M2x12mm (total length 13.8mm) screw and hex nut: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B014OO5KQG

Print
-------
Print the parts upside down for accurate port dimensions.
If you prefer better exterior look, print upright with a raft to minimize height error.

The ring is for joining this adapter together with the mini HDMI to full HDMI adapter for the N64Digital, for better mechanical rigidity. It should also help even if the HDMI adapter is not in place, so the adapter can't sag and damage anything.
https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4924766

Assembly
--------
File the Wii end of the PCB so it has a chamfer on both the top and bottom side of the board. This is to ensure it doesn't destroy the contacts inside your Wii component cable.

Solder the two PCBs toghether. Note the ""This should NOT be visible"" silkscreen print and obey. Then solder the SNES header onto the PCB assembly. Note the ""Top"" print. This indicates the way the notch on the plug should face.

Place the soldered assembly into the printed shell and screw them together.

When challenged to design something for my son to hold his Nintendo Switch at varying angles, he showed me something that was purchasable already for around £10GBP. That in mind I wondered if I could design and sucessfully print something that was exactly what he needed. 

Many.... Many hours later and we had a functional unit, but then I decided assembling the thing was a process we could remove with some further strategic design to ensure printing without excessive support requirements and still allow all parts to function as soon as it comes off the bed.

Little sleep and 3 versions later and we are fully functional.. This is around 295mm for printing so will require a 300mm+ bed, but once print complete hinges and latch will rotate free from printed location with little pressure and work without any further assembly, be mindful though of the outer case latch print orientation, whilst printing horizontallly would add structural integrity, the face quality of the final print was less than impressive, after adjusting to this print orientation, better prints came off and nothing has broken, but I suspect getting heavy handed with the latch on first movement would cause some snapping... 

Switch can be charged while on stand with cable route designed into shell and andjustment support arm- Run cable through the triangle shape, through hole in hinge area and up to Switch as shown in pictures. 

Not the fastest to print, but incredibly satisfying. . 

With supports, take caution to ensure your slicer doesnt attemp to put any within the hinges . I found best setting to from build platform only and manually placing the ones inside where needed - Recommended supports placed under large hinge for adjustment support arm to be sure it does not foul frame at any point of operation as the tollerances are tight.

NOTE: Regarding the nut, if your printer is dialed in and able to print fine details, the threads on the sleeve and nut will mate very well.  To loosen the thread fit, scaling up the nut 2%-5% will increase the slop between the two.  In addition, make sure no loose stringers of filament or high spots are on the threads.

**Update 2 (13/02/2021):**
I'm still working on the viewer and making prints. As of today, the visor WILL NOT FIT the helmet. I'm sorry for the inconvenience. I'm working in it.

**Update 1 (12/12/2021):**
- All files where updated increasing the size.
- The neck part of the helmet has been increased
- The visor has been completely redone.

Maybe increasing the size could be used for cosplay

Any suggestion is highly appreciated!

See you!

====================
[Look at the video on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/w7yiuq/finally_got_my_deck_and_im_ready_to_introduce_the/)
This is the Spine! It is a universal mounting bracket for the Steam Deck! You can mount (almost) anything to the puck and have it secured to your Steam Deck. You can also rotate 90 degrees and mount that way, making it easy to change up how you have something mounted. The Spine also has small slots along the edges of the bracket, which allow you to mount using small velcro straps instead of pucks. Or, you can use them to hold down cables to keep things organized or secure. This bracket is slim enough to fit in the stock deck case without getting in the way

What do I need to make this?
====================
A 3d printer, access to a 3d printer, or know someone/have a local shop that can print the files
2 - countersunk M1.6 10mm machine screws
2 - countersunk M1.6 12mm machine screws
2 - 4mm x 25mm pen springs, smaller springs will work but might not have the strength to hold heavier items

I have the parts, now what?
====================
Once you have all of the parts printed, and you have the screws, springs, and VHB tape, you will need to mount the Spine to the deck. To do this, remove the 4 inner screws from the back of the deck, and place the Spine on the back of the deck. Use the 10mm screws on the top two mounting holes, and the two 12mm screws on the bottom two. 

Now, you will need to assemble your puck. Place the springs in the holes in the clip and the other side in the sliding file prints. Squeeze them together to press fit the parts together. You might have to squeeze quite a bit to have the sliding piece fit into the clip of the puck, but that depends on your printer and settings. Once together, you might have to squeeze the sliding piece in, and pull it back down a couple times to break it in. This is normal, and after doing this for a number of times, it will move as intended. Now, place a piece of VHB tape on the puck, and remove the film to attach it to the device you want to mount! Please follow any instructions that came with the tape on cure/set time, it should be very quick however. If you are mounting a battery pack, or something else very heavy, you may need 2 pucks to make sure they are secure.

How do I use the Spine?
====================
To use the Spine after assembly, you place the side of the puck that does slide on the top side of a mounting square of the bracket. Push up, and the springs will compress, letting you push the bottom side of the puck into the mounting square. Once in, release the pressure on the top of the puck, and it should slide into place! Try to always have the side of the puck that does not move on the bottom side of the mounting square, that way it will always hold in, and not slide under the weight of the accessory

Other questions or notes
====================
This is in alpha design, and you might need to test parts to make sure they work with your accessories. As of now, I have tested the mounting brackets and pucks, but I am in the beginning stages of testing with the SD card holder. I already know it doesn't hold SD cards well if they are cheaper ones, and that looks to be because those cards are thinner, and the holder uses friction and pressure to hold the cards in.

The sliding part of the puck looks really close to the print bed, and that is by design. It is more than enough to hold a spring in, and won't cause any issues

Can I remix the Spine?
====================
Please! Any remixes are more than welcome, and I would love to be able to use remixes that I can't design myself.

Can I sell the Spine?
====================
While I can't stop you from profiting from something myself and the community has created, I would appreciate you DM'ing myself and any creator that you want to sell their designs. I will be more than willing to work with you on a license to sell the OG Spine and any parts I have.

It was downright astonishing to me that I could find <i>LITERALLY ZERO</i> square replacement gates for Sanwa joysticks ANYWHERE. 

There are about a million octagonal ones and circular ones and diamond/clover ones, but I haven't seen a single, regular replacement square gate. Still kinda blows my mind that nobody has ever needed to replace their gate in a hurry.

So hopefully someone finds this useful.

Printing settings don't really matter, but I printed with 4 walls and 4 top/bottom layers for extra strength since I'm sure the gate will take quite a beating over its lifetime.

Print time is ~1 hour @ 45mm/s and .20mm layer height. 

Not sure why my example print kept the weird top triangle pattern but when I slice it now, it's not there.

Snaps right into place under the joystick and can be removed without damaging the connecting parts.

I think that is because SBS bends relatively easy. And IMO PLA will be more suitable than SBS, as it is stronger. Can't say anything about PETG, but should be ok too.

I'd personally print one with cuts if printing from rigid plastics as original part from ABS has them. With SBS it was too easy to bend. so I printed solid version.Hi, what kind of material did you use? I think PETG should be suitable, PLA is to weak I think ..."

Because honestly, I fixed the original in 3D builder, so there's probably flaws that I didn't know how to repair at the time. But the ORIGINAL version literally would not work because the vertices didn't even connect together at multiple points on the print. Seriously, I spent the time and material to build the original model only to have it fall apart the moment any weight was applied to it. 

If you are referring to this version, there are two versions of the katana tip. I split one of them in half so it would work better on my printer, but there is another version that isn't split. At the time I didn't know how badly 3D builder could mangle my models with the split feature but, hey, it's what I knew how to use.

I made this repair as a beginner to 3D printing, but it turned an impossible product into something that was actually feasible to make (as demonstrated in my pictures). I'm always open to constructive criticism but this came across as a little caustic, to me.

Would the non-split version be usable for you? At this point I have learned how to clean up that kind of damage and I would be happy to fix it. All you need to do is ask.Comment has been deletedWhere do I find the metal piece that connects the top and bottom of the weapon? And do I print at 3000% like the original one?The metal part you can find at a hardware store. The slicing software will tell you how large your pieces will be when you print them, so the resizing is up to you. I don't think they'll need resizing but I can't remember. "

this is a solution so I could exibit the virtual boy control in the tripod it stands on.
i used to put it below it, where one couldnt see it toroughly.

you need to print two of each pieces, you can mirror one of them in order to look more symetrical, or not.

I designed it in two pieces so it would be easier, faster and cheaper to print, also so you dont require supports. just apply some super glue once they are printed and stick them in the legs of the tripod.

would be more than happy for comments, suggestions, makes and remixes.

I wanted to be able to mount it on the wall since our tv is mounted on the wall in the corner of the room with all of the electronics conceled behind the tv. The wire connections on the dock are located in the back which makes it stick out farther than I would like if I mounted it on a shelf or something. 


I made the following changes to DylanWave's original design to fit parts from my aftermarket dock as well as allow the dock to be wall mounted:

1. Backplate - Removed the stand connections and added holes for wall mounting.
2. USB-C port - Changed the screw mounts to remove the factory springloaded system. (Aftermarket dock has a rubber gasket mount that alows movement for the USB-C connection)
3. Added supports for the changes I made to the USB-C mount.


*All screws I used were from the aftermarket dock. (3-point switch screwdriver is required if you don't want to strip the screws.)

2 x M4x4x20mm Nuts and Nolts

NOTE: When you install it, make sure you slide it forward to take up the slack in the shifter movement. The shifter should just be touching the switch, so when the magnet lets go, a shift happens instantly. The magnet helps stop false shifts and gives a nice snappy shift, as found in the very expensive wheels.

which took parts from the original complete, which can be found here:
https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2059192

I liked the cover, but thought is was a tad on the tall side for a bottle cap, and required multiple parts to assemble.  So I combined the two into one object and squashed it down a bit to look more in line with the height of a bottle cap and still look stylish

I also added some holes on the bottom for air to escape from the valve, and left the keyring holes at the top because I didn't feel like removing it, and to remind me where this idea started from.  And it wasn't hurting anything.

I know it's probably not perfect, but don't hate me.  I'm still a n00b at all this :)

Edit (5/12/20): Added an updated version that removes the inner logo so you use less supports and the inside top looks cleaner.

So I was looking for a mount for all my different controllers, but most are designed for stands or just a single controller, and while I designed this specifically for the joycon grip, I found that it works with most controllers, its not perfect, the gamecube controller actually has to be put the opposite way round and the arms are SLIGHTLY too narrow for the ps4 controller, but as you can see in the photo, they do stay on there just fine.

I was able to print this on a prusa mk3 with no supports in PLA. Will probably work better long-term using PETG or ABS.

Requires disassembly of both your elite strap and the bobo vr m2 straps.

On BoboVR M2:
Remove the back strap from the front assembly on bobo vr by unscrewing the screws on the inside of the ring, then using a flathead screwdriver push pull the button piece off the outside, and after that push in the 3 snap-fit tabs to release.

On Elite strap:
get a small flathead under the outer rubberized black layer (be careful not to get under the middle one) and pry open. It is a snap-fit plus some adhesive tape inside.

next remove the screws holding the interior black hard plastic shell to the white outer assembly (screw length from left to right = Medium, Small, Large, Small, Large, Small, Medium). Lastly, on the top and bottom edges, push in toward the center on the black piece and remove the snap-fit there. you should then be able to lift it off (if you have the battery version, do this CAREFULLY and make sure you're not pulling the whole battery internals up as well).

Now the prep work is done, get a heat gun or hair dryer and gently soften the printed arms to match the curve of the elite straps, then reassemble.

The ratchet teeth for this will work as a platform for the elite strap assembly, meaning this could be modified to replace the normal elite strap arms entirely as well (the ones that crack)",,"['bobovr_m2', 'elite_strap', 'oculus_quest_2', 'quest_2_elite_strap']",3,985,69,0,2,2,Gadgets,video-games,"thanks! glad you like it!Elite strap broke and Facebook replaced it, telling me to toss the old one.

==============
HOSAS extension designed for Virpil Constellation Alpha joystick.
This should work, or be adaptable to other Virpil grips, to Warthog grips, or any grip using a M36x2 thread.

The extension is designed to work as a single print.
For testing & checking purposes, print a captive nut and with a grip nut, and use these to work out any issues.

I've included a scaled HOSAS file.  This is the one used for my working extension.
For the captive (or base) nut, both the  x and y diameters have been adjusted. (x: 1.0247, y: 1.03077).  This suits my printer and filament, and fitted my base very easily after clean up.

The grip bolt didn't need adjustment.

The threads were made using Adrian Schlatter's  thread lib (here:  https://github.com/adrianschlatter/threadlib ).
This in turn depends on a few other downloads, linked on that download page.

Other Parts
---------------
*Extension Cable*
----------------------
You will also need a suitable extension cable.
I bought a 35 cm cable from skypetrew on EBay, here: https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/292244604143

Alternatively, you could make one yourself using a pair of 5-pin miniDINs and some suitable cable.

Either way, the centre hole of the female socket needs easing for Virpil's grip plug.

1) Quick print

The Quick Print uses the:

Virtual Boy Adapter Body (Printed with the holes on the bottom)
VB B Clam (Printing on it's side)
And the Tripod mount of your choice.

Print each part as suggested you might need supports for the top part of the adapter, and once printed place the 1"" machine screw into the adapter and screw it in (you'll need a thin and long screw driver)

Place the B Clamp into the machine screw and place the wing nut behind it. This will be used to clamp the virtual boy to the adapter.

Finally attach the mount to the bottom of the adapter with the 2 1/2"" Machine screws, hammer in the nuts for a more secure print.

2) The 2cm print

The 2cm print has more parts but is shippable by Canada Post, and stronger since the arms which holds the Virtual Boy is printed along the potential force.

Print the A and B Clamps on their sides and the Adapter on it's bottom.

When done place the 1"" Machine screw in the hole on the Adapter put the Plug in after it, and hammer in a 10-32 machine screw from the top. This holds everything in and attaches the A Clamp to the Adapter.

Screw a 1/2"" machine screw into the A Clamp and screw that into the adapter til snug.

Now place the B Clamp into the 1"" Machine screw from the adapter and place the Wing Nut behind it.

Finally take 2 1/2"" machine screws into the bottom of the adapter, and screw in the mount of your choice.

4680661,Daemonbite SNES Super Famicom Case,https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/8b/3a/67/a8/e6/large_display_dbgrey.jpg,2020-12-10,10,13,0,"Case for Daemonbite SNES/Super Famicom controller port, which lets you use any SNES controller as a USB gamepad on PC, MiSTer, Raspberry Pi, etc.

Daemonbite project info here:
https://github.com/MickGyver/DaemonBite-Retro-Controllers-USB

This is a pretty small, utilitarian design - basically I just wanted something that'd hold the pro micro and the controller port in place so that the solder joints wouldn't get stressed. It ended up being a pretty small case, with a little window for the activity/input LED, but also needed a window for the tallest components on the pro micro - the tantalum capacitors. Luckily, since that window is fairly close to the power LED, you can also quickly see when it's plugged-in. It uses a snap-fit closure, so there's no need for any other fasteners - just print it, carefully place the components inside, and snap it closed! 

**Notes:** This is marked as a WIP design as I'll be totally redesigning based upon the measurements I figured out from this one. Please take a look at the pictures to see if your SNES controller port is similar to the one I used - there are differing ones out there. Also, this is a very small case; you'll want to make sure that you use very short or thin wires.

https://www.thingiverse.com/make:986177Unfortunately thingiverse never rendered my model for viewing when I uploaded my remix. It also won't let me upload new photos upon an edit and a save (they never show).

If you checkout the makes section, I added a few photos there to work around the limitation for top and side views :)

You could definitely bring it in a little bit but I'm not sure if you could elminate the bridge entirely. Aesthetically I found the current spacing to satisfactory, hope this helps!Was planning a similar remix myself but was planning on bringing them a little closer together (i.e. the front of the rear one merging with the back of the back one) - is there enough space? It looks like there is quite a bit of give in your picture but wonder if that's just the angle!

It make swapping banks on the flash cart much easier.

For anyone wondering what that the Flash Masta is, it's a flash cart for the Neo Geo Pocket (NGP) and Neo Geo Pocket Color (NGPC).

Due to the variances in Flash Masta PCB revisions, I've made three versions of this switch in hopes that one of them will work for most anyone out there who needs one. I have two Flash Masta carts, one which used the old Linker that Flavor also provided, and one of the newer models which has a USB port on-board. The switch on each looks the same but my first design only worked on one so I made a slightly wider version which worked with the other. However, this wider one wouldn't work on the first PCB due to nearby components that would potentially be at risk of getting hammered by the switch cover. 

Additionally, most models out there likely came in an original SNK NGP shell with a small hole cut out to access the switch inside. Since these were hand cut, I suspect the exact location and size of every hole is going to be a bit different. I've tried to design the Slim and Wide versions of this switch cover to fit in either of the ones I have, but YMMV - worst case trim a little more room for this switch to fit with an Exacto or Dremel. 

Flavor has since released a [3D printable shell](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2373193) with a hole in the location of the newer USB models (top left). I printed [lions3's](https://www.thingiverse.com/lions3/about) [modified version](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2422485) of this shell for testing and made an alternate Round version of the Slim switch since I could be sure the hole would be in the same spot for everyone if they used that shell. 

Here's a rundown of the differences:

**Wide**: This one works best on my older model Flash Masta where the switch is facing up and is located on the right side of the PCB. Both the base/cover and the switch itself are a tad bit wider than the Slim model.

**Slim**: This one works best on my newer ""USB"" model Flash Masta where the switch is facing down and is located on the left side of the PCB. Both the base/cover and the switch itself are a tad bit shorter than the Wide model. Should also work well if you're using one of the 3D printed shells mentioned above and prefer the flat switch style over the rounded one.

**Round**: Basically the same as the Slim model, but with a rounded switch that looks a little nicer when used with the 3D printed shells. These shells are also a little taller, it seems, so I may end up updating this design so that the switch sticks out a little further, but it works well as it is.

My only word of warning would be that since I cannot verify component placement on all versions of the Flash Masta out there, use your discretion when installing and make sure there aren't any components near the switch that this cover may push against.

This is a quick and basic box to fit a dual rotary encoder used for flight simulation setups. It will take the encoder board and an arduino nano without any modifications to them. Meaning, I ordered the nano with the pins already installed and soldered the pins on the encoder board straight in so I could use jumper wires to connect them. It all fits inside the box but that's all you're fitting in it. It is tight but shouldn't cause bending of the pins. I've thinned the thickness of the front where the knob goes to allow for the threads to come through so it can be tightened in place with the nut that is typically included with the knob.

The back just pops into place and has a cutout at the bottom for the nano's USB port. If you cram it all in there correctly it should line up and stay in place for connecting and disconnecting.

The mounting tab fits it on the left side of a Honeycomb Alpha, it could easily be remixed to fit on the right side or even other brands of yokes. Seriously, it's just a box with a hole in it, modify it to your heart's content.

So i bought a Virpil WarBRD base, attached the MongoosT grip and did the mandatory settings to get it fully functional (firmware upgrade, axis calibration and button check). After that i took it apart and salvaged the USB controller PCB and cables to implement them in the G940 base. The old grip and its electronics were completely removed and the gimbal rod was shortened by approx. 50% (picture 2 shows the part that was cut off). I got the CAD data for the thread from Baur at Virpil forums: https://forum.virpil.com/index.php?/topic/656-warbrd-base-thread/&do=findComment&comment=6006 and designed a fitting for the G940 gimbal rod.
fred41 from the DCS forums made me a special firmware patch to disable the G940's deadman sensor: https://github.com/fred41/G940-firmware-fixes/tree/ffb_experimental
This is a 2in1 device now, one USB connection is the G940 base with all the axis sensors and FFB motors, the other USB connection is the Virpil section (controller and base connector) for attaching the MongoosT-50CM2 grip.
One mandatory step after printing is using a threading die M36x2-6g to cut a perfect fitting, clean thread.

Upgrade 2020: oil dampers!
To support the motors with the much heavier grip, minimize the mechanical deadzone and enhance the fantastic haptic feeling i added two ABSIMA 135mm oil dampers.

Electronics parts will be documented later, you can use arduino leonardo or zecodelay devices for wiring the switches.

Steps:
- Open Eaton Fuller and install (glued) the micro switches with 2 cables normally open when the sticks are down and back.
- Optionally you can drill and install one press button (for air brakes or retarder).
- All connections will be done with 3 wires and one common wire, to one JST female connector.
- Pass the rest of the cable through the shifter, getting hide all of then.
- The cable will enter side by side the original cable. If your cable has enough cores you could remove original one (rewiring) or left both side by side.
- In order to put the cable inside you must open the shifter and drill a small hole to pass through the lower side to, leader dust protection and al last Eaton Fuller.
- Separate the cone-Base of the Eaton Fuller. Drill the holes (2mm) to screw to the adapter.
- Print the adapter and put it inside the Eaton Fuller cone base.
- Then pass the cable (only four wires) through the leader dust protection of the shifter, the printed adapter inside the cone and then put the male JST 4 wires.
- Screw it (cone and adapter) to the shifter stick.
- Connect male and female connections.
- Test with multi meter, each switches and later reassemble the Eaton Fuller head and screw it to cone.
- Build and wire the Arduino adapter; If you are using a G25 oy G27 you can wire the Eaton Fuller installed switches to and any existing buttons. In this way no Arduino or zero delay boards will be needed.
- Test it in PC.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Weedle (ビードル Bīdoru, Beedle), known as the Hairy Bug Pokémon, are larval Pokémon found in the wild early in the Kanto and Johto regions. They are very weak Pokémon that are captured to be evolved into their cocoon-like Kakuna form and eventually into the hornet-like Beedrill form. Weedle have little pink feet and a pink, round nose. Commonly spotted in the forests and grasslands, eating leaves, Weedle are well-protected from predators by sharp two-inch barbs on their heads[80] which secrete a strong poison, and another stinger is on each Weedle's rear. Sniffing with its big red proboscis, a Weedle uses its extremely acute sense of smell to find the types of leaves it eats.[81] Often living in forests and grasslands,[82] it eats its weight in leaves every day.[83]

Didn't want to paint the whole thing, especially making the rune look good, so I thought that an LED would be a cool addition.

I used two 5mm blue LEDs fit into the MeetStone_LED-base wired up to a 3v coin battery.

The LED_base is magnetized to the MeetStone file with 1/16 cylindrical magnets.  

In the files section there are two different files for the MeetStone, ""combined"" and regular.  I initially printed it without the little tabs to hold the magnets, then printed those and glued the in after the fact.  The MeetStone_combined file has these tabs combined into the model so no need to glue these in separately, but now sure how dimensionality will change with supports and whatnot.  So if you print the ""MeetStone"", and want to magnetize it, you'll need to print the files for the MeetStone_mag1, 2, & 3.  I put little tabs to mark where each of there line up with the corresponding holes on the LED-base.  

On my print, I had a switch wired in to the LED circuit, but cut a hole by hand through the bottom of LED-base to turn it off and on.  I wasn't sure where I wanted it to fit, with having the coin battery tucked in there too, so this was easier for me than modeling it in.
