Since then, Cricut came out with Foil Transfer accessories, so I needed to add a place for those in the design. My wife also got another cutting accessory, so I increased it to 7 accessories.

While doing this, I realized my initial design wasn't easily modified, so this new Fusion360 design is easier to change the number of main accessories with a single parameter.

I've uploaded design files for her design, plus generic models for the single accessory holder and the foil transfer gizmo for folks to use as a building block for their own holders -- basically I draw blocks and ""subtract out"" these generic models from where I want the accessories to fit.

The design is very simple to print -- if printed bottom-side down, any resolution should work with no rafts or supports, with whatever infill you'd like. I printed with 0.2mm resolution, 15% infill.

Folks have asked if they can sell prints of the earlier design. That is fine with me (that design and this one), as long as you give me some attribution, as called out in the Attribution-ShareAlike license this is posted under. I'd love it if you'd drop me a note, too, as it makes me happy when other people build my designs.

My Triplett analog meter from 1971 sits on the shelf...part of the museum.I think my count is closer to ten.  They're far more accurate than the analog needle type meters that were common when I started doing electronics more than 50 years ago.  IM[NS]HO, they're worth EVERY PENNY of the price, even when you include the screwdriver or whatever you choose to buy to get one ""free with any purchase"".  ;-)

Actually, I have a Fluke 77 that I use for high voltage or when I need to use a calibrated meter.  I've also got a couple of ""bench"" meters that will do 4-wire resistance when I need to get down below about 10 ohms, but the ""cheapies"" do probably 98% of my measurements.  (And if one gets smashed or lost or fried, no big loss!)"

I've got  a Overlord 3D printer this year.

As a delta printer, it's quite tall and shapes like a 'Hexagon castle'.

So I design a 'Hexagon stronghold' for this castle, as a a tool container used in 3D tool.

1. One Glue Stick.( for hot bed)
2. Screwdriver and 5 bits. ( for adjustment of the plate)
3. a Vernier Caliper.(Measure height when bed leveling) 
4. a pliers.(for Cutting filament when reloading)
5.a shovel（for removing model)

With this, you can find a home for all your Overlord tools.

I've been riding around with it on my bike for a couple of days now, and it holds tight even over very rough roads, riding down curbs, and so on. There are more parts now, but such is the price we pay for robustness.


I wanted a place to store my bike road tools, so I made this saddle box for them. This is custom-fitted to my bike and seat, and so I can't guarantee it will fit yours.

You'll need additional hardware to assemble this:

* Two M4 x 10mm x 6mm brass screw inserts
* Two M4 bolts, 6 - 10mm long
* Three M3 x 4mm x 5mm brass screw inserts
* Three M3 bolts, 6mm long 
* 1mm rubber sheeting

Print:

* one each of the strap and top
* one of the bottom. This will require the use of supports, on the build plate only
* three latches and three guards

Assembly instructions:

* Install the M4 brass inserts into the holes on the sides of the strap (see pic).
* Install the M3 brass inserts into the holes in the three spindles on the sides of the bottom piece. This is not shown in the pics (sorry, I didn't take new pictures after this modification.)
* Line the grooves in the strap and top piece with 1mm rubber.
* Line the large groove on the front of the body with 1mm rubber. You'll want to attach this with an appropriate adhesive.
* The three latches snap onto the spindles. These take a bit of force to get them on, but once seated properly allow the latches to rotate easily.
* For each of the three guards, insert an M3 bolt in the hole in the guard, and screw the assembly into the brass inserts in the spindles. These keep the latches from popping off when riding over very hard bumps. If you don't need that level of robustness, you can leave these off entirely.
* Place the strap on top of the support bars under the bike seat so that the support bars rest completely in the grooves.
* Slide the top piece up from below the support bars so that the mounting block mates with the fingers of the strap.
* Attach the top piece to the strap using 2 10mm M4 bolts. (I actually used 6mm bolts, but I wouldn't go much shorter than that.)

The bottom is attached and removed from the bike using the latches. Each latch has a lock tab that allows the installation of a small lock. This won't give you great security, but might be enough to prevent casual theft.


** Note ** There is a groove on the rim of the top piece that is intended to accept a gasket to improve water resistance, and a Gasket.stl file to print the gasket with flexible filament. In practice, however, this is unnecessary. I'm including this just in case you want to make this box hurricane-proof.

Love the design, How did you get the ""legs"" to attach to the wire rack?  I find the fit a little too tight and cannot snap the legs to the wire rack.Is there any reason that a bunch of material couldn't be removed from the bottom of the HMD interface to reduce print time and plastic required?

https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4515684What filament is used for the HMD support - is it standard PLA/PETG or did you use a flexible plastic?This is amazing!!!!! Great work!! Can someone remix this to a wall mount system?I got everything printed, the issue I am facing now is the overall width of my rack is much smaller then yours.  I did a very quick measurement and it appears that there is a 35mm offset per side to get the pole-hook to mount up to the hmd mount.  Is there any way to make some further adjustments to the pole-hook-size-2 stl?  the fit around the pole is spot on, the only other addition you might want to think about is cutting a small hole in the pool-hook-size-2 stl so you can secure a zip-tie around the mount and the wire rack to make sure the mounting is secure.

Thanks again for all your help, looking forward to getting this all set up!Thank you, printing now!Added!Added - pole-hook-size-225.65mm is the OD of the poles, 13"" 5/8 from outside of pole to outside of pole.Appreciate the help!

Thanks again!Sorry -- thingiverse didn't serve me this comment. I think I get what you mean, but that could be hard to print with the steep overhang, but then again you could use support materials. Next time I revist this design I'll add an optional part for the HMD with less plastic.Yep -- I've had a few people report this, it seems like not all wire racks are created equally. If you have a set of calipers, you could send me the outer diameter of the pole on your wire rack, as well as the distance between the ribs and I could model you a new set of legs. This is so great!

I KNOW THAT YOU CAN BUY SMALL STORAGE BOXES AT YOUR LOCAL HOME IMPROVEMENT STORE FOR CHEAPER THAN YOU CAN PRINT THESE. IF YOU PREFER THOSE, GO DO THAT. ;o)

These require some 300mm X 2mm rods. I found some on Amazon. I used a Dremel cutting wheel to cut them to the length needed. 

https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07B6MFB3N/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1

You also need some (3) M3x5mm screws for each box that you print. The screws go in the ends after you slide the 2mm rods into the hinge holes. One end is printed closed and after you slide in the rod, you use the M3 screws to close the hole on the other end.

The only place that needs supports is the lower box TWO front snap extensions.

ALSO, FYI - I printed these with a .4 nozzle and used a line width of .45. That is important because the interior walls are 1.8mm think (4 line widths) and the outer walls are 2.7mm thick (6 line widths).

WARNING: These take a while to print depending on your print speed. For me the lower box takes about 22-24 hours and the top takes about 11 hours ..... AND that was at 80mm/sec speed.

Box specifications: 
Dimensions of the outer walls of the bottom box (all boxes are the same) = 270mm x 200mm 
(NOTE: There is a photo included above, showing the MAX overall dimensions including clasps and hinges.)

Sizes of 2mm rods needed: ONE 246mm long for the back hinge and TWO at 44mm long for the snaps.

ALL of these boxes have compartments that are 35mm deep. 

Box V1 has 44 compartments at 22mm X 46mm (inside size)

Box V2 has 48 compartments at 31mm X 30.5mm (inside size)

The quality of the guides could be better, but all in all, its a well designed product. Before, I was sharpening my knifes by hand on Japanese whetstones, so I am used to good quality sharpening stones. And this the one flaw the Ruixin set has. The stones begin clogging after just about 1 min. So to keep on grinding you have to constantly dress the stones to remove the metallic layer build-up. Otherwise grinding capabilities decrease so far, you will not be happy, not to mention your knifes wont get sharp. Having some experience with Boride grinding stones (usually these are used for tool finishing) to sharpen my ceramic knifes, I looked for suitable stones to sharpen my steel knifes. I wanted to try one without the need for water (oil treated) and one for wet grinding, which holds shape well. These are the ones I found most suitable:
https://www.borideabrasives.com/PublicStore/product/AO,32,315.aspx (Oil treated, softer)
https://www.borideabrasives.com/PublicStore/product/TH,33,316.aspx (impregnated, use with water, harder)
In germany you can get these here (I recommend the test set):

https://shop.procof.de/Schleifsteine-TH-Test-Set-1841084.html (rough set)
https://shop.procof.de/Schleifsteine-TH-Test-Set-feine-Koernung-1841085.html (fine set)

https://shop.procof.de/Schleifsteine-AO-Test-Set--1840698.html (rough set) 
https://shop.procof.de/Schleifsteine-AO-Test-Set-feine-Koernung-1840699.html (fine set)

I bought the rough set TH, because for aggressive grinding its good to have stones that hold their shape well. Also tried without water, its no problem. And I bought the fine set AO, for finishing the knife and not using up to much of the softer stones.

To use these I designed the holder you find here. It's a very easy part, but now I can print one for every stone and glue them on to have the same quick change ability as in the sharpening set. 

Have fun with this :-)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I designed this remix with the intent of making a longer, slimer version that could use my printing bed size to it's fullest.

The original craft was taller than wide due the the sliders, it mean your 1 part craft is going to be limited in Z size even though you could go wider in X-Y axis.

So i propose to make it into a multiple part craft. I even used the diagonals of my bed at 120% scaled size at a 35% Z angle. This setup is the biggest a Prusa I3 can go, using 24 out of the 25cm wide X Axis.

Other arguments to be made out of a multiple part crafts is that you can use multiple colors with a single extruder setup, and can better arrange your time. instead of a 36h craft that can miss even at the last 5%, you have smaller crafts with less supports, all printed flat on bed for an easier print.

As mentioned by SoLongSidekick, just a cavity on the inside to drop some superglue into would be ideal.I'd love to print this, but i have a nonavong XLS, and that would probably not fit. Can you drop the step files so i can remix it myself?Really great idea, but why have a complicated bottom-mounted door with necessary screws that easily strip in printed plastic instead of making the bottom solid and just having an indent the exact size of the magnet and then just adding a tiny drop of super glue to the bottom of the magnet before pressing it down into place from above? 

EDIT - I'm even more confused now, with the current design there's plastic in between the magnet and the hot cap, right? It's gonna melt pretty fast isn't it?"

I don't think I can safely heat my plate that much, there's important ABS-made things nearby.  I always clean excess plastic off the nozzles, yes.  Swabbing with alcohol is a great idea -- I hadn't though of it, it's probably greasy with fingerprints by now.


You probably know, but a word of advice for anyone reading this, 'rubbing alcohol' can contain things like mineral oil!  Be sure to use the ""99% pure"" kind of alcohol.
I recommend you to level the bed headed the nozzle switched off, so you don't have any material on the nozzle messing up the leveling.


I most cases i level the machine by eye control. Sometimes i use 160 g/m^2 Paper to fit under the nozzle. When i can move the paper with a senseable and constant friction at some control point's your bed sould be leveled well.


The correct leveling and the correct nozzle height is essential for the adhesive behavior of your print. Also i always clean the bed with 99% alcohol.


ABS especially:


The strain in big ABS parts is really heavy. Once i had the parts printed, they hold on the kapton tape but the tape itself got loose from the print bed. This definitiv is still problematic. if you heat your bed up to 120 C° this should minimize the strain in your parts, but i never reached it and getting up to 110 C° took me hours and finally melted my y-belt clamp leading to a mess.


So because it's easier i primarily print in PLA, and ABS only if i need the material specs.


if i am lucky i can print up to 10 print's without releveling the bed.
Makerbot Replicator X2 with kapton tape and bed heated to around those temperatures.


I usually don't print with raft, but when I do, the raft can peel too.  Everything always peels from the lower left, though I've taken pains to carefully level the bed.  (As carefully as I can, just the depth gauge and vernier on a metal caliper, hopefully accurate to 0.1 mm.)


Maybe preheating the bed, THEN levelling it would help?
Hi There, 


I have a repaired Version of the mesh, but as you i didn't had any problems with slicing the part.


I just printed a second version because my first print is used to 100%.


What kind of printer do you have. I am Printing with a RepRapPro Mendel 


If i print with ABS i use:
T0: 250 C°
Bed: 80-95 C°
Glass Covered with Kapton Tape


Printing PLA:
T0: ~ 205 C°
Bed: 65-80 C°
Glass Covered with Kapton Tape


Without Kapton Tape, printing ABS is not a good idea, it never worked for me. Even with Kapton i always use a Brim or Raft function especially printing with ABS.


Kapton Tape makes your live much more easier.


Will Upload the new STL Ans A Photo of the second Print soon
The mesh didn't give me any trouble for some reason.


It's by far the biggest thing I've ever printed though, and it peeled badly, even on a heated build plate.  The leftmost hole was useless.  I rescued it by punching another screw hole through the back, and now it holds a lot of workbench clutter.


I still get a LOT of peeling though.  Is it because I'm printing in ABS?  Maybe my build plate isn't getting hot enough?
It is kind of messy mesh. The back wall of the object ""in front"" poked trough some places.


Could you please post the individual parts (as STLs) that you used to make this?


Otherwise, nice design :-)

The original intent was for a Wireless Launch System LCO controller case design for PIC microcontroller & Board, keypad, 4x20 display, li-ion charge circuit, 4 18650 li-ion battery pack and a 900Mhz modem.

Project Pics here:

There are only three items printed, Base box that will hold the controller, modem and batteries with the top lid lower section housing the keypad that mounts from the bottom side (keypad flange inside box) There are two hole in this lid that are used to link the lid to the LCD display and angle section.  The angle 
section is variable in angle and length to accommodate the required display and function stuff.

Adding the extra detail for the inside components gives and idea how the things will fit and any potential interference.  This allows for adjustment of the components and the resulting cut-outs to be accurate.

https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3552442

I loved the design, BUT the lid was a terrible fit. The indents for the 'bumps' for the hinges were the same size as the bumps, despite being offset, which made the lid a super loose fit, to the extent that it would easily fall off when opening, and the handle was very loose too.
Also I liked the photo of eligreen's print, with the little latches in a separate color, rather than the same color as the lid, so I made them separate parts that can just be glued on. If you do prefer them to be a single piece, then let me know in comments, and I can make a version that will print as one, but personally I think they look much better contrasting.

Thanks to eligreen for the original design and inspiration.

I designed the new lid from scratch (using measurements from the original as a guide) in Fusion 360. The parts should be a tight fit, and it may take some effort to snap the handle and lid covers into place, but they should fit. I printed the lid in Hatchbox Yellow, and the catches (and tray) in Fusion Filaments ""Radioactive Orange"" HTPLA+. (my print of the black parts was in Fusion Filaments ""Ionized Cobalt Black"" HTPLA+ (which has a subtle sparkle).

video: https://youtu.be/nkmlPsL690c

This functional print was designed to emulate another one of the Saami peoples vital tools. 
Most modern people forget just how important not having holes in your clothing is; especially when you are in -40 degrees! Its for this reason that the Saami felt it necessary to carry a set of needles and thread on them. Traditionally made with reindeer antler or wood, and leather, they provide a strong, secure case for carrying several needles.

PRINTING NOTES:
 Most of the art was just done with a sharpie. feel free to decorate yours as you see fit!
You will need supports. Rafts depend on your printers capabilities.
Its designed to be made using 550 paracord as the string. Assembly is required.
A piece of soft leather (like deer leather), or potentially of frictionate cloth is required to finish this print. Im debating making a printable sheet with flexible filament to go with it for this purpose, but i cannot print flexi at this time. 

TO ASSEMBLE: 
tie a knot in on end of the paracord, push the other end of paracord through the ""cap"", going from the wide end to the smaller end of the cap. pull the cord through all the way to the end knot.
next, run the cord. through a sheet of soft leather, or potentially  a thickish cloth (never tried cloth, cant vouch for it). that leather/cloth should be cut to fit within the main case body when wrapped up.
 next, run the cord through the opening of the main case body, and through the hole in the top. this may be a bit difficult. 
after that, run the cord through the toggle nut, and loop it back through the second hole in the toggle nut. you can adjust the length of cord to what you feel is right, and tie off the end (or melt the end to the nut like i did)

heya, yeah, I've just come to realize that it's just my interpretation that's wrong too :-) The base interlocks fine, so as you say it is just the hole excluding some of the dovetail.

I've just been poking around at the URL, and it appears the /edit versions lead to a 404 now. Strip that out and it takes you to a page with a 'Copy and Tinker' button. 

Thank you again though, this is a super collection of tool holders :-)I see it now, it probably just bad luck with the hole for the socket and dowetail.

Many thanks for posting these awesome sets! Perfect collection for someone with a multitude of different socket sets.

I've just discovered that the imperial socket holder set, 5.16_-_7.8_socket_holder.stl doesn't interlock correctly. At the 5/8th interface there seems to be missing parts of the dovetail on both halves.

It also has space for 4x deep well impact sockets up to 84-85mm in length.  I have more use for the metric sockets, so they reside in easy reach.  If you remove each of the top layers, the SAE sockets are accessible below and the extension is in a custom hole in the hinge-side top print.  Things are spaced so that the lid and driver should keep everything in place when toting the PACKOUT around.  It makes for a pretty dense package, but it's all there when you need it.

### CryptoPlastic

What do you get when you cross Bitcoin with 3D printing?

## A Bitcoin Paper wallet

Except it's plastic. They say you don't own the coin unless you own the private key.
Safer than paper, more insecure than steel.

This can be used to store your private key. Make sure you print enough letters. This wallet
can hold a maximum of 16 characters per line. 64 characters total. This means you can store:

* Private Key WIF (51 characters base58, starts with a '5')
* Private Key Hexadecimal Format (64 characters [0-9A-F])
* Private Key BIP38 Format (58 characters base58, starts with '6P')

You can view it in 3D [here](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2335490).

To test it out, I will hodl some Bitcoin here: **1FVjCBrdA2rKZKq6jyAZQQ12erZxHk9UXd**. Feel free to donate :)

## For the paranoid

This 3D print also includes a 1d16 hex die. By rolling it 64 times and writing down the
values, you are in fact generating a bitcoin private key (in hexadecimal format).

## Test prints

I am currently printing this on Yellow PLA with a layer height of 200.

The final print is 18cm x 10.4cm x 1.13cm. Once the print arrives, I will post
photos.

## Important

* If you lose coins because of this wallet, it is your fault, it provides
no guarantees
* This is an alternative to CryptoSteel
* I **DO NOT** recommend this over CryptoSteel",,"['bitcoin', 'crypto', 'cryptosteel', 'paper', 'wallet']",1,560,4054,0,0,2,Tools,tool-holders-and-boxes,"Seems like a good and free backup to my steel backup!I would really recommend splitting this up into separate files.

Bending it is not near as scary as you make it sound. It is quite easy and was done for a long time without breaking The hole in the end actually isn't even really big enough for the rod to go through easily. But, if you would like a hole on the end you can place the rod vertical with the bracket against the floor and a quick rap of a hammer on the rod will produce an almost identical hole. That is how i did that hole. Kinda forgot about that and did not even consider it when I took the picture. But really feeding the rod through a hole is more of a pain than it is worth. Just bend the bracket enough to pop out the rod and if it breaks after a couple years print another one. I used mine for years without a failure.Not as pictured. The rod/dowel hole does not go right through the side (it is solid on the sides), so you can't slide the rod in order to add/remove more spools. You will have to either modify the model before printing, drill out the side, or remove one end from the wall every time you want to change a spool (or try risking bending the brackets outward)"

You can customize the height, the length, the separations in the drawer, etc. If you want a different style of drawer, you only have to print separators and design it like you really want it. It saves you a lot of filament, because you don't have to print a new drawer each time you want to change the design. 

Step 1: Print the Cassing

For the drawer, you need to print at first the cassing. there is two types of cassing; the first one is a plane looking one and the other one is a pattern one. 

Step 2: Choose and Print your Drawer(s)

Now, you decide the height and the length of your drawer (Ex: TH3L1 = 3 compartment high and 1 compartment long). There is 9 different types of drawers. The height and the length is the only thing that change drawers to drawers. All the drawers have a different code; The ""T"" at the beginning of the code stands for ""drawer"". After, the ""H"" stands for ""Height"" and there is 3 different height (1 = 1 compartment high / 2 = 2 compartment high / 3 = 3 compartment high). You make your choice of height according to the number of compartment you want your drawer to be. You do the same process for the lenght of the drawers (the ""L"" stands for lenght). The lenght of the case is 3 compartment long, so you decide if you want 1 L3 drawer, 1 L2 and 1 L1 drawers, or 3 L1 drawers. 


Step 3: Floors and separators

After choosing and printing the type of drawer(s) you want you need to print a floor for the drawer to sit on and you need some separators if you want separations in your drawer. The separators have the same type of code than the drawer, but the code starts with a ""S"" standing for ""Separators"".

Step 4: Assemble you drawer and Enjoy!!

Super easy to assemble. The drawers have sluts for sliding in the separators. The case also have sluts to slide in the floors. And there you go!

With the 3D Scanner App from Microsoft you can scan free hand and also with turntable but both is not optimal. A lot of objects have not enough reference points to detect correct position and also up and down scanning is hard to figure out. Free hand scanning is too imprecise and causes issues when coming too close or too far. 

With this little helper you can place an object on a fixed platform and you move the Kinect around with exact same distance and viewing angle. This makes scans much better. It adds the precision of platform scan while the scanner software can still use the background as movement reference. Just use a metal pipe as a shaft that is long enough. You can then slide the Kinect on it to get good distance. Start scanning and move the Kinect around in a perfect Sphere shape to get all sides of the object. 

My sample scans are made with very bad light conditions and my cables are still too short (and my room too small *g*) but the results are better then every scan before.

In fact, I was unable to find anything that would hold sizes over 3/8""; I wanted a holder for every common size up to 1"".

So, after a good bit of math and design work, here it is. It holds the 22 most common hex-wrench sizes, commonly available on McMaster-Carr, from .026"" to 1"". 

I've allowed plenty of extra space in each size, but not so much that any other wrench can fit in that spot.

I've included two versions, one that uses simple hole-diameters and another that uses the actual hex shape.

Currently these are just plates. Ideally these would be remixed into either a wall-mounted version or one with legs. Right now it's just a plate with properly made holes, no legs or mounting accommodations made. Maybe I'll do a future version with legs / mounting plates in place. But if you really want to use this for now, I suggest laser-cutting it from 1/32"" steel, dog-bone shaped, and then bending the ends down to create a tall stand.

Or, if you print this in plastic, catch it from the ends with wood or something to create a stand.

The hole-only version is fully filleted, but I left the other undone to match the old-version we have in the shop from 30 years ago. Basically, the round one is for making in thick materials like plastic or wood, and the hex-shape one should be used for thin steel or aluminum, thus you don't need a fillet on it.

Lastly, this is under public-domain dedication, feel free to take for whatever use you desire and remix as you please.

Although it was designed for this product, I expect it could be used to hold tape or any other similar rolled product. 

Print Orientation:

All of the STL files should be in the print orientation that worked for me by default

Supplies:

A. CA glue and Activator

B. 5""x9""x3/4"" wood board

Hardware:

C. 2x 608-2RS Bearing

D. 4x 1 1/4 Kreg Pocket Screw (I had these on hand, similar screws would work too. The length is so it can attach to a 3/4 piece of wood)

E. 1x Coping Saw Blade (I was lazy the with cutting mechanism, this works well enough for now and I had an old one around, I bet any other type of fine tooth blade may work as well)

Assembly:

I used CA glue and activator spray to assemble the 3d printed parts where needed. Be careful using glue on the bearings so you don't accidentally lock them up and make them useless.

1. The Through Bearing Anchor gets carefully glued to the inner ring of the bearing.

2. The Sanding Roll Insert gets glued onto the cardboard tube that comes in the packaging (This holder may be able to be made longer with a longer tube, although I don't know how much weight the hardware can handle)

3. The Bearing+Insert assembly gets glued into the sanding roll insert, with the Through Bearing Anchor sticking out of the tube.

4. If the peg sticking out moves freely repeat this step with the 2nd set on the other side.

5. Figuring out where to attach Mount R and Mount L can be done by placing the Through Bearing Insert Pegs into the slots on the Mounts, Then squaring them up on whatever you are attaching them to. You could take measurements to figure our where to attach everything, but this was easier for me. Depending on what type of wood you attach it to, you may or may not need to predrill the holes to get a nice tight fit. I did, but I was attaching to a scrap piece or red oak which is quite dense.

6. Final step is to put your rolls on and attach the coping saw blade to the bottom of the board. I used CA glue because it was quick and easy, and I didn't want to design and print another piece. I'm sure this could be improved upon, If I end up doing that I will update the design to include that. 

Additional:

I cut out the piece of the packaging that displayed the grits and ca glued it up to the top. I would suggest this, but not necessary. I also saved the cardboard spacers from the box to keep the rolls from overlapping, would definitely suggest doing this too.

They're intended to be easily removed, so yes, probably loose enough so that if you tip it upside down they will fall out.  I guess this is a matter of preference, but I went with ""easy to access.""

for 2. It is a very snug fit, and for good reason-- it should dock very easily, with reliable contact, with the buttons on the screwdriver facing on the angled-down side (the LED should be lined up with the hole in the side).  I used the cable that came with the screwdriver, so other cables might not fit well.  Make sure any support material is removed.  The cable end should fit very tightly into the base (not really intended to be removed often/ever).  Once it is in place, the screwdriver should dock with a slight ""click"" of the USB C connector.
I guess if the fit is too tight, I recommend filing or scraping the edges a bit to get the cable in place.
I've only put the cable in once, so I don't have a lot of test cases :-DHey. I printed it out and it came out great but I have two questions.

1. Is the screwdriver and bits supposed to be press fit or loose in the dock? The bits are just sitting there but if I was to turn the dock upside down all the bits would fall out.

2. How did you manage to get the USB cable through the hole. I'm not able to make it fit.Thanks!  Yeah, I end up using it a lot more this way since it's easier to keep charged and ready to go whenever.This looks awesome.

Au fond de cette boite on peu y loger le transformateur USB avec son adaptateur FR, le cable USB-C, la clè Allen et le câble anti-parasite.
Sur la partie support, je peux clipser le fer ainsi de deux pannes et comme il restait un peu de place, j'ai aussi imprimer une petite roue pour enrouler de l'etin dessus.
En espèrant que cette boite plaise au possesseur de ce TS80. 

I just got my new toy, the awesome TS80 soldering iron. Normally, I should have received with this order a color box as a gift to store it but Banggood to forget to include it in the package. So I decided to create a custom box for the protected.
At the bottom of this box we can accommodate the USB transformer with its FR adapter, USB-C cable, Allen key and anti-parasite cable.
On the support part, I can clips the iron and two iron tips and as there was a little place, I also print a small wheel to wind on the tin.
Hoping that this box love the owner of this TS80.

Edit: You're right about the width of the middle boxes, although for me they fit alright if you close the lid with attention to that detail.

For the feet, I emulated the underside of the original boxes here, and as I never look at the bottom, I don't care about their looks. However making them bigger would kind of make them superfluous at all, wouldn't it? I assume they are meant to allow for some dirt or dust to gather between them, so from a functional perspective I wouldn't choose to make them smaller.Comment has been deletedCool. But the middle boxes should be just 0.5mm narrower to make the lid close properly and lock outter boxes.

It should be 59.5 x 31.0 mm. My printer printed the part almost exactly 60.0x31.0. It looks like maybe 60.2x31.2 tho.

Printed on my MendelMax 1.5 with 20% infill and .25 layer height. After reorienting with cad software to be edge down, printed in 5.5 hrs for both pieces on one plate. Only item is that the 2 pieces do not fit snug together and since I printed in black I used some black electrical tape around bottom rim to provide snug fit. Thank you for the print I really like it otherwiseI believe my original slic3r settings were 5 perimeters minimum and a layer height of 0.4.  My printer is a printrbot plus.  My extrusion multiplier may have been dialed down at the time to 0.98 or so.  I used PLA plastic.  Slip fit printing is tough to calibrate and Porting it to another printer could take a few tests.  I'm actually glad it worked as well for you as it sounds it did.  When starting this project, get some sandpaper and print a half inch to an inch of both pieces, sand smooth and test the fit.  If it's too tight is how you'll want the pieces to come out, so that you can smooth the surface and remove material with sanding.  Thanks for the feedback."

Actually, the whole project got out of hand and it turned into a complete system.

It all started with a box of assorted wire that I ordered from China. The spools came arranged neatly in a little box allowing you to feed out just what you need. But while the idea was great, the implementation was lacking.

The box was made out of cardboard, which didn't hold up very well in use, and I didn't care for the wooden stick running down the center holding in the spools. Also, because there were no separators between the spools, the wire had a tendency to despool off the sides of the spools and make a tangled mess.So I set about to improve it.

The first thing was the box. By designing a box with individual partitions, I cleaned up the mess. Also, by creating the press-to-fit spool holders on the side walls, I eliminated the need for a stick.

Then I discovered that I actually had wire in two different spools sizes, one narrow and one wide (for larger gauge). So I created another box size. 

Next up was the spool. I designed half a dozen of these with different fastening mechanisms until I settled on a simple annular clasp that I liked. 

After that, I wanted to solve the problem of how to put the wire onto a new spool. I designed a spool cover that would snap over the spool and allow you to spin it, winding the wire on it. Of course, I also needed a version for the wide spool. (Note, because of the design of the spool, it only works in one orientation. If you put the spool in upside down, you'll just spin the end of the spool and won't wind the wire at all.I should probably label the end of the spool, but I have to stop somewhere.)

After I snapped the cover over the spool, I discovered 2 things. 1) The cover is a great standalone dispenser for individual spools of wire. 2) It's hard to remove the spool from the cover. So, I designed a small tool that presses the spool out if you use it to push on the bottom.",,"['diy_electronics', 'electronics', 'spool_holder', 'wire_holder']",9,573,299,0,0,0,Tools,tool-holders-and-boxes,

1) No supports, one piece, easy to print. 
2) OpenScad parameterized to fit your table(s) thickness.
3) Stays secure on the table edge, but is quick to slide on and off. 

### Background ###
When mishkin2 uploaded their Desk-Mounted Bin, I immediately printed it. Shortly after, I found out the screw and the bin didn't fit, and it made me wonder - why do we need any of that? 

This was originally intended as a remix of mishkin2's the desk-mounted bin. However, I have since designed and created my own version from the ground up. 

### How to use ###
The openscad file included with this model is for you take, make adjustments and print your own bin to your own table thickness, bin depth, bin height, etc. If you just take the stl file, you will be printing something that fits butcher block - 44.5mm thickness.

I’ve been meaning to redesign this one because the other fault my kids have found is due to printing in an upright position makes it susceptible to breaking along the layers. 

Need more time. :( There's a small gap under the back corner on the very first layer; this causes the printer to create a very long bridge on layers 2+ until eventually the bottom surface starts to cover everything. The print didn't fail, but that part of the print is on the ugly side. Is there a reason for this? I thought it was a slicer bug at first, but you can actually see it in the STL viewer."

The diameter of my tank (the place where you attach this guard) is 28.52mm, and the height of whole guard is 115mm (blue plastic color on images)

Also I made a version for 43mm tank with 125mm height (black plastic color on images), it fits a U.S. 5 lb. CO2 tank. Thank you, Kenneth !

Your tank may be different and this is why you may like to download the original design and modify it:
28.52mm version: https://a360.co/2OTLECj
43mm version: https://a360.co/369fXv2

I printed mine from PLA with high (50%) infill ratio, and of course I can break it, but the main goal to prevent accidental valve rotation. So far (3 weeks of usage) it stays solid and works good.

It may not work with scuba tanks because usually they have a valve on left/right side.

To assemble the 28.53mm version you'll need:
* 10 washers M4x9.0 mm
* 2 screws M4x20 mm (20mm+, but not shorter)
* 3 screws M4x35 mm (35mm+, but not shorter)
* 5 self-locking nuts M4

mount holes are spaced at a whole number of inches, on-center.

These holders are intended to be mounted to a rectangular 1-inch grid of holes.  
The mount holes in the holders are, by design, not (necessarily) centered horizontally on the holder.  The horizontal locations of the mount holes are set so that the distance from the left-most face of the holder to the left-most mount hole is constant, so that multiple holders can be arranged neatly like left-aligned lines of text on a page.

I'm back with another Tinkercad design.

I am experimenting with Airtag tracking of mobile industrial equipment and I could not find an existing case (Commercially or on Thingiverse) that suited my needs, so thought I would design one and share it with you. 

The link to the Tinkercad files are here: https://www.tinkercad.com/things/inMV4gkf4U2

A few things about the design:

* Dimensions are 50mm W x 50mm L x 13mm H
* The case is designed to be robust and can withstand a few physical blows. 
* The case can be made waterproof by dispensing RTV, silicone, polyurethane, or glue into the circular mating channel (noting that this will make the separation of the case at a later stage difficult).
* The design mutes the speaker, but is not soundproof - the random chirping that occurs every few hours when the Airtag is away from its owner cannot be disabled. Instructions exist online on how to remove the Airtag speaker.
* The Airtag fits snugly in the center of the case to prevent it rattling around. Four gaps have been left, to allow you to pry the Airtag out.
* The case can be screwed or glued down to the device being tracked. 
* In one of my photo examples, I have screwed this case to a block of timber, but you can also use self-drilling/self-tapping screws to screw it to metal substrates. 
* If you are using double sided tape like 3M VHB to attach this case to your device being tracked, you can use metal thread screws (Flat head countersunk M3-05 x 12mm) and 5-6mm nuts to keep the top and bottom pieces together.
* The case should be printed using non conductive material, as to not to create a faraday cage and impede the RF. (Eg: standard PLA, ABS, etc)


Printed in PLA, with 20% infill.

希望大家都能好好的！

There are many designers on the Internet. Designing water repellent hoods and anti-fog hoods for the 501 of the 3M gas mask are very powerful, but unfortunately, most of them cannot be tested for sealing after being installed because the hands cannot be completely covered. In the original wearing instructional video, it is mentioned that after wearing a gas mask, you need to cover the air inlet with both hands and inhale. Test whether the gas mask is worn properly and the seal is good. The air outlet should also be tested to see if there is a leak. The only cover I think can be used by only one designer (modbus_TCP), but what he shared is for the higher-order canister 60926. The frame of 60926 is relatively narrow, so it cannot be applied to the 3M 501 cover. I imported the STL into Tinkercad for modification. Simply adding width and adding 4mm thickness can be mounted on the 3M 501. The disassembly and assembly are all aspects, so the process is to wear a gas mask,seal check, and then the splash-proof cover can be snapped on.Thanks, modbus_TCP.

Hope everyone will be good!

https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4588442



This is a collection of battery and battery charger holders for the Black and Decker 20V MAX Batteries (both regular size and extended 5.0Ah batteries).

<strong>These models have the following features:</strong>

* Models for Extended 20V batteries.
* Mounting holes to use with #8 screws (non pegboard versions).
* Versions for mounting on 1"" peg board (with pegs which you can optionally use #6 x 1/2"" or M3 screws to better secure the holder into the peg)
* Versions with a clip for storing the charger.
* Charger storage versions have built in cable management guides.
* Holes in the bottom of the holders for possibly better airflow (my extended batteries have vents in this area).


<strong>To determine which file you need, the files are named according to the options they include, for example:</strong>

<strong>BD-20V-Battery_Holder_V38_REG_CHARGER_PEG.stl</strong>

<strong>REG</strong> = Regular Size Battery
<strong>EXT</strong> = Extended Size Battery

<strong>CHARGER</strong> = (yes or no) has a clip for holding the charger

<strong>PEG</strong> = (yes or no) mounts on a 1"" peg board



If not using the pegboard mounts use #8 screws for mounting.


For a more secure mounting on the pegboard, you can optionally install #6 x 1/2"" or M3 x10mm screws in the holes which go through the pegs.  Note that it is possible you could damage the holes in your pegboard by screwing the holders down through the pins.  I have installed and removed these without damage to my pegboard after using the #6 screws to lock the pins in place, but I was careful to work them out when removing.  If concerned, you may want to try testing the pegboard pins with screws in an obscure location first with the screws you plan to use and try M3 screws instead of the #6 screws which are a bit larger - or omit the screws all together.  

If you are just needing a charger holder, I made one you can find here:

https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4552501


The STEP file is included for easy remixing.

Parts are not oriented for printing, but I suggest printing them in the tall orientation (same way they would be mounted on the wall).  Supports are required for the pegboard versions.

Well, look no further! This adapter will help you to secure your new bottle in your car's cup holder.

##Recommended Material: PETG or ABS##
Why: The inside of your car will get hot in the summer! Using PLA or other lower temperature filament will warp in the hot sun. However, you are welcome to try PLA if you like, but I speak from experience with my test prints (in PLA).

Features:
- Adapts your bottle to a standard cup holder
- A drainage hole in the middle for easy cleaning
- Drainage hole also acts to save on material during printing

Make sure to correct the orientation of the parts in your slicer.",,[],2,514,176,0,2,4,Tools,tool-holders-and-boxes,"Hello,
Thank you for the comment.

You need to re-orient both parts in your slicer before you print them. The bottom part that holds the gauges needs to be oriented with the bottom on the print bed. The cover needs to be oriented with the top down on the print bed, so basically upside down. With these orientation, there will be no overhang to print.

Hope this helps!I like the design, but it was hard to print the top cover nicely due to the fact the item is on its side.  If the cover so that the wide base was on the bottom as it printed, it wouldn't have the problem of building a long string across open areas. 
I'm thinking about giving a shot printing this.  Anyone print both the base and cover without issue?Looks just fine in both cura and craftware.  So don't know what the problem was,  I will try printing it again.  The wide(3/4"") slot does not show on either programs but is near an edge and extends most of the front or back of case.  Anyway I may try again once I have time.

Thanks
DaveRight picture but wrong top files.  I only printed the top.  Top had a slanted inside and an open part on the top of lid.  Not sure what issues you are having, but the prints pictured are from the files attached. Plenty of others have successfully printed this case.

How does the part look like in your slicer?"

Shallow SAE set: Harbor Freight Item # 61339
Deep SAE set: Harbor Freight Item # 69344
Shallow Metric set: Harbor Freight Item # 61292
Deep Metric set: Napa Evercraft 10mm-19mm Set
Wrenches: Harbor Freight 3/8 Breaker Bar, Bostitch BTMT74111 3/8 Ratchet
Extensions: 2x 9"" or 220mm extensions, 1x 5"" or 130mm extension and 1x 2"" or 51mm.

I am printing mine with a pause once it finishes the top skin, to change to orange for the lettering, so it stands out from the body of the print and is easier to read.

I've hung these on my pegboard using normal pegboard hooks, but the diameters are different so they don't sit right. I've been wanting to design holders for them for a while, and finally got around to it.

I have both the original [DAG-1](https://www.parktool.com/product/derailleur-hanger-alignment-gauge-dag-1) and the newer [DAG-2.2](https://www.parktool.com/product/derailleur-hanger-alignment-gauge-dag-2-2) - and although they're similar, the sizings are a little different, so they need different hangers. Both are included here. We also have a DAG-2 at the shop, so I took some measurements from that and have the appropriate piece for that one as well.",,"['alignment_gauge', 'alignment_tool', 'bicycle', 'bicycle_tool', 'bicycle_tools', 'bike', 'bike_tool', 'bike_tools', 'dag-1', 'dag-2', 'dag-22', 'derailleur', 'derailleur_alignment', 'park', 'parktool', 'park_tool', 'park_tools', 'pegboard', 'pegboard_holder', 'pegboard_mount', 'pegboard_tools', 'rear_derailleur']",6,286,367,0,1,2,Tools,tool-holders-and-boxes,"I just printed the DAG 2.2 version and it fits the tool and pegboard well. Really well done. I have one little suggestion though - the hooks that hold the tool could be a little longer to wrap around the tool more securely. As it is, a small bump while retrieving another tool could easily dislodge the DAG. The DAG-2 mount doesn't work.  The largest diameter ""shelf"" that looks like it is supposed to support the main barrel of the tool needs to be removed.  Additionally it won't insert in my 1/4"" pegboard because the hooks are too large in diameter.    Well, yeah, that's the problem - 1/4"" _nominal_ doesn't mean 1/4"". My pegboard measures out at 1/4"" (see the photo) and the old pegboard we had at the shop was nominal 1/4"" but it was a noticably smaller actual hole. 1/4"" = 6.35mm and thus I go with a 6.6-6.7mm diameter with a 3 degree taper (6 degrees included) for the roughly 3mm depth of the pegboard (1/8""ish) with the hook to keep it in place better. This way it's a good snug press fit on 1/4"" holes by design. On my pegboard, I install the hooks and then give it a firm push and it stays in place. Might not even need the hooks at that point.

Having the fit be too loose, you run the risk of it not staying in place that well and it might fall out when you pull the tool off the wall if you don't pull it off exactly right. Have run into that, having to pick up and reinstall the pegboard piece is a pain in the butt, thus the press fit design.

I made the pegs 1/16"" smaller (closer to 3/16"") - try the attached STL.It's all good.  My OP says this is with nominal 1/4"" pegboard.  You can probably make your posts a 1/16 smaller and it will still work fine and give more room.  Entirely possible, I personally own the DAG-1 and the DAG-2.2. The model for the DAG-2 was based on measurements taken on the one at the shop. I'll print it out and see how it works. 

As for ""too large"" - pegboard holes vary wildly, and I sure can't fix it for you if I don't know what size we're dealing with. Mine is 1/4"" and the pegs are designed to fit tight - and they do. Back when we had pegboard at the shop, that was a smaller diameter, maybe a bit bigger than 3/16""."

Pegboard holder for a set of 9 Allen keys / Hex wrenches / Inbus wrenches. Designed for sizes 1.5–10 mm (common Wera sets). Pegs on the back are for 25 mm vertical and 15 mm horizontal hole spacing grid (can be edited in Tinkercad using the link below). The warning note on it is just random Czech (slightly dirty) workshop humour :)

**UPDATE 2:** I've uploaded a new version (2.0) with a triangular block added behind the smaller wrenches to prevent them from rotating towards the back and falling out. I've also added an STL for only the block itself, which you can print and superglue to the original version to upgrade it. I'm leaving the old versions here, but version 2.0 is the go to one.

**UPDATE 1:** I've added a version with wrench size labels.

Should be possible to print vertically without supports thanks to the slanted base. It is quite tall, so a brim may be a good idea. The top pegs may come out a little ugly, use supports there if it's too bad (it was totally fine without supports on my Prusa MINI though). You can use the ""pegboard_test_piece"" to try if you need supports or not.

Der Beispielhalter wurde aus 3 Schichten 4mm Pappelsperrholz hergestellt.

Sadly OpenSCAD isn't really what I'm usually using and editing STLs in FreeCAD is kind of buggy, so customizing them wasn't that much fun. To make my life somewhat easier I modeled a similar design as a customizable FreeCAD box.

Inside the FreeCAD file you'll find a spreadsheet named variables. Open it and change width, length and height according to your needs. The resulting model should update automatically. Keep in mind these are outer dimensions, so ff you're looking to fit something specific inside, take this into account. Wall thickness should be adjusted for your needs, 0.8 as used in the template is pretty thin and might not fit your needs when using PLA.

Tolerances are quite tight, opening or closing the box may require additional force and/or tools.

With Flashlight in clip in helps keep it secured to slide, so you may find it kind of hard to slide the magnet assembly off with flashlight still in clip.

If your flashlight isnt pretty much a perfect cylinder you will have to shim out the clip with some washers between the Ratchet and the Clip (cannot exceed the ratchet circle if using metal washers).

Also I was able to make it ratchet both ways and remain stiffness in the mechanism, but i have not tested the longevity of that.  It was accidental while trying to thread a bolt in it.  

Which leads me to the my next point, I prefer a bolt through method instead of a tap method.  Tapping into the plastic ratchet just isnt worth the trouble, and the hold just doesnt feel quite right when your ripping the Magnet assembly off your belt.

Printing instructions:

Print everything in the default orientations at <= 2mm^3 for best results.

Base.stl & CapBracket.stl - Print using your own choice of settings.  I'd recommend 10-15% infil with a single .5 - .8 wall.

TowerSection.stl & DollarStoreLightBracket.stl - Full support, I chose 10% with lines in an old version of Cura. PRINT THESE PARTS SOLID. The light bracket is very ""bendy"" and somewhat fragile...this was intentional to save material.  Don't skimp and try for infil.  Make it solid.

Do not glue the cap bracket and flashlight bracket together.  The flashlight is meant to be able to spin 360 degrees.

Print as many of the TowerSection.stl as you need to make it as high as you want.  I made 3 for mine.

However, i didn't like the strange size of his original design, so I set to create a perfectly square box in metric system.

I also wanted to have different heights (for small o very few items) and make them stackable.

I figured it was also a good way to learn OpenSCAD, and here is the result.

It took me a while and in the meantime Chappel made some improvements to his original design and so did Niptrion. 

While this is was created from scratch, I took ideas and concepts from both of them so thanks to both!

This is still a work in progress, and will be posting updates in the future.
This is my first time using openSCAD and my first time creating a customizer (so, i'm not even sure it will work in Thingiverse)

What is Done:
* parametric design will create boxes depending on your needs:
* XCount / YCount: number of units one each dimension
* width: size of the box unit (default 50 mm) this is the size of each ""building block"".
            currently each  building block is a perfect square.
             a 1x1 will be 50mm x 50mm a 2x1 will be 100mm x 50mm
           This also controls de size of the Grid the boxes sit on.
* height: Height of the box (default 25mm)
* thickness: wall thickness (default 2mm)
* radius: radius of the curvature (default 4mm). Actual share will be elongated in order to improve printing (to avoid supports)

Pending:
       - Handle/Label holder inside the box (will be lower than the edge to allow stacking
       - lid in case i need it.
       - Grid to mate the boxes to.

Most folks don't appreciate the usefulness of TP as a tool for quick, small cleanups of things other than poop, but I do so keep rolls of TP handy wherever I might otherwise need to waste a full sheet of a paper towel.

Of course, if you actually need a toilet paper holder for the bathroom, no reason you can't use this one. Only possible issue is I didn't make any effort to conceal the screw heads so I'm guessing there are ones out there which will look more ""finished"".

This holder addresses the issues I had another one I had used, and has a better overall fit. The flip-up holders can't flip all the way up so won't get stuck vertical. I think it also looks a little nicer than the previous design.

One note - this was designed with a uniform 0.2mm clearance all the way around. I'm constantly being told that my designs ""don't work"" and my only guess is when they work for me and not for you, you very likely have a printer that isn't properly calibrated.

Included 2 versions (Spitted and Full). The split version can lay flat on a printer. So it can print faster and a lot easier. The parts are also stronger when printed this way. But they need to glue together after print. For full version can print vertically as one part.

I only test split versions that are very easy to print. I design it with slots so it was easy to align them together when gluing. I use A-B Epoxy.

By the time I had finished repairing it, I almost had enough parts designed to make parts to convert a small bag or box into a wheelie tote box.

It could also be fitted to a toolbox etc to make it a wheelie toolbox.
The exact positioning of the parts is up to you.

Updated wheel to from solid to version to 5 spoked wheel
If you make a bag into a tote box it will need a plywood insert inside the bottom of the bag.

Or a box will need to be rigid enough to take the base support and stand parts.
The tubing for the handles was 16mm steel tubing, 76cm long or 30 inch seems about right
If you would like me to add parts for different size tubing, let me know and I'll see what I can do.
.

The main parts should assemble using 6mm or 1/4 inch bolts.
The wheels can be fitted using 6mm or 1/4 inch bolts with locknuts.

The tubing can be secured using 3mm bolts or thin screws using the holes in the handle and base.

Printing in PLA or ABS etc should be fine.
The base part should be printed in the supplied orientation, with supports.
No supports required for anything else. Raft or brim not required unless you really need them.
The wheels can have a thin rubber tyre (tire) added to them after printing, by simply wrapping a layer or two of self amalgamating tape around them, but don't wrap the tape over the sides or the wheels won't fit or may bind.

This was a quick project so please forgive me if I'm unclear or have missed anything, just let me know.

So just download it and pop it into [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/) if you want to edit it.

I found those bits to generally be anywhere from .10mm to .30mm larger than their metric equivalents so I re-sized the bit holes on this design to be .25mm larger than the metric bit size.

And where can we get the file for the pin to connect the halves?? You left out so very necessary info man....

EDIT:  And I just cracked the bottom piece trying to hammer in the magnets. So ridiculous. What a waste of time.

Hi - can you please give more info on these connecting pins? Where can we download that and do you mean to stick three of the pins between the two halves of one part of the dentures and then glue the halves together with glue on both the ends of each pin, and also between the surfaces of the two parts? I'm not quite understanding without a little more info and some photos.

Also what size do we need for the bigger center magnet?

This is a mobile solution too, as a nylon tool bag can fit quite a few of them (my DeWalt DCBAG3 can carry up to 20).

Flambeau used to make them, but changed the design and now makes tackle boxes with different compartment sizes. They are not as good as before, in my opinion. What I buy now days are Westward 2HFR3 9"" x 4.5"" 18 compartment boxes that I pick up at Grainger Industrial Supply.

While convenient, these boxes are not without deficiencies, some of which I will try to address with this thingiverse entry.

1. 
<i>Problem</i>: Black Westward logo is written across the box. It is annoying to look at, while I want to see through at the compartment content.
<i>Solution</i>: Dampen a paper towel with acetone and wipe the logo off. Acetone will dissolve the paint easily without damaging the polypropylene box.

2. 
<i>Problem</i>: Dividers in some boxes are crooked.
<i>Solution</i>: That's where I miss Flambeau's quality. Since you might not use every divider in every box, perhaps you can combine good looking dividers from several boxes. Or, just print them: STL is provided.

3. 
<i>Problem</i>: Sometimes, an item cannot fit neatly at compartment boundaries, and I need to remove a divider and sacrifice another compartment entirely. I wish there was a way to change the size of a compartment.
<i>Solution</i>: That's what step dividers are for. See one of the pictures where long bolts (machine screws) are stored. Note how three bolt sizes can fit in one row. Without step dividers, only two sizes would fit in a row, wasting 33% of space.

4. 
<i>Problem</i>: Thin parts (washers, for example) slide under the dividers into different compartments. 
<i>Solution</i>: Use pull-out boxes as illustrated in the first picture. You can print a lid too, if needed. Note that the boxes behind the lid locks at the front of the compartment box need to have notches in order for the lid to close.


<b>Printing</b>
Tolerances are everything, especially with the lids. Use X-Y adjustment in the slicer software to slightly increase or decrease the size of the lid. A proper fitting lid should slide in and out with little effort, but have enough friction not to open on its own.

If a lid is still slightly too tight, you may want to take fine sandpaper and rub the edges and the corners of the lid against it. I used grit 1000, but grit 400 will probably work too and is more readily available.

That said, I will upload several lids, with different tolerances. For example, a lid with 0.1 mm tolerance means that 0.1 mm is subtracted from the lid's horizontal dimensions. You can test print each one to roughly understand what tolerance do you need to start with, and later do a fine X-Y adjustment yourself. I find that for my printer I need 0.11 mm or 0.12 mm tolerance, depending on the filament.

Pull-out boxes have fillets at the bottom to fit the contour of the compartment box. This is not the best design from the 3D printing perspective, but the fillets do not have to be and look perfect.

Dividers can be printed up side down on a raft.

Unfortunately, my subscription to Fusion 360 has run out so I no longer have access to the original part files. Maybe when I have some free time, I'll recreate new files using Onshape and repost them. 

The pin is there to lock the box shut in most box orientations and give the appearance/feel of a locked dovetail. However, if you flip the box over the pin will become recessed in one of the box halves and allow you to slide the two halves apart.

Thanks for taking a look!     Hey something happened with your file. Maybe units got switched around at some point but the model is extremely tiny and since i'm not sure what the pin's purpose is i don't know how to scale up the three models the same with the crappy XYZware slicer my printer came with. i hope you can get this fixed since this is a cool little puzzle.

The ToolTote is designed to have a complete set of tools, for around the house use, in the smallest space possible.  Tools are positioned with the working end up so it is easy to find the tool you need.

Screwdrivers is designed to hold these common Craftsman Screwdrivers:

Slotted:
3/32 x 1 1/2 #41541
1/8 x 4  #41589
3/16 x 4 #41581

Phillips:
P0 x 1 1/2  #41542
P1 x 3  #41294
P2 x 4  #41295

An extra hole is provided for a larger driver (Point Down) and a wall to hold a small measuring tape.

Pliers is designed to hold 5 Pliers, should fit most Plier Sets handles

Drill-Driver is designed for a Bosch 12v Drill-Driver. Most Drill-Drivers with a 1/4"" Hex drive extention should work.  It has holders for extra 1/4"" Hex bits, drills and extentions.

Parts Holder is designed with a cup to put loose screws in, a drawer for holding some extra screws, a place for a torpedo level, a small flashlight and 2 Pencil holes.

T Handle has a hole for a pencil, marker and small utility knife. If you need a hammer, carry it in your hand while holding the handle.

Blocks and Handle were designed for a small print bed or you can combine all the parts into one model and print the whole thing as one piece.  If the blocks printed seperately, you can glue them together or better yet, drill throught the back of each Block (throught Handle) and bolt together.  Wells have been included in Drill-Driver Block to allow room to fit nuts on the end of bolts.

CAUTION: Since all the tools are point up, be careful not fall on ToolTote or you will be stuck with all your tools.

This are just some additional mounting parts to connect two fantastic designs together, 

See my pictures above

The 220mm Flower shaped Pinwheel with ball bearing by DonKracho on Thingiverse: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4216400 and 

the Rotating Leaves for Pinwheels by DonKracho on Thingiverse: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4278995 

Under both designs above I could not find any mountings to connect it in the way I wanted it to be.
Thats why I have designed the 3 parts below

1. SHW-Leafes Mount straight.stl  to place below the ""BallBearingCenter.stl"" of the rotating 
    leafes and to connect with a M4x40 screw with one of the following 2 Spindel versions.
    The 3 leafes needs to be glued then around into the BallBearingCenter circle.

2. SHW-Spindel Leafes-V1.stl in case you just want to build a pure leafes wind wheel.

3. SHW-Spindel-FlowerLeafes-V2.stl in case you want to combine both builds, the flower 
    and the leafes as one build, like I did.

Remark: Both Spindel versions have a M4 threaded whole included for an M4x40 mm 
               screw to connect the Spindel with the straight mount through the ball bearing.
               The V2 also has a threaded whole on top to be able to screw in the threaded rod 
               M8 x150 mm 
               The threaded rod can also be longer if wanted but not shorter then 150 mm to 
               avoid any contact with the flower wheel above by rotation.

If you combine both designs, you  also need a Threaded rod M8x150 mm or longer to combine the Spindel-FlowerLeafes-V2 with the ""AngleMount.stl ""of the Flower shaped Pinwheel.

I have added also two All in One files in case you have a perfect adjusted print bed.
One is for the Pure leafes wheel V1 and the other for the combination with the flower wheel V2.

For the flower design you need to download all parts from the original https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4216400
This design is very big and on Ender 3 Pro you need to extend the bed dimension to 235x235 mm and I could do it only with 3 mm rim and the design needs to be placed exactly into the middle of the bed.

!! Ensure that your printing bed is realy 235 x 235 mm and your printer can handle it !!

Enjoy printing and if you like it you can post me a make of your final wheel.

I don't ever know what kind of stuff I will need, so I thought about it and this is the result. A cute ellipsoidal ('Beaned') keychain hard to open (pressure is configurable as you tighten the spring). You just need a M3x30 screw, a small spring, a M3 nyloc nut (recommended) and some glue. Insert the nyloc nut in the top part, Insert the M3 screw into the spring and screw it into the nut from the bottom part. Depending of the spring size you may have to use a shorter M3 screw or cut it down. Do your proof till you feel the thingie can be opened/closed comfortably, then use some glue to fix the parts supplied to hide the holes and you are done!! The bottom hole filling part should be trimmed according to your setup. Easy and proffesional. Don't let your friends see it or you'll have to make some for them. You can figure out why I called it 'BeanBox'. Its not big but also no tiny. Its just the size I needed, it can hold 25 cm3. and works perfect for me. You have to file it a bit to get a perfect fit. Also nice results are got when sanding its surface. As you wear this thing in your pockets or necklace I don't recommend to paint it unless after painting you apply several varnish layers. Not a toy, it is designed sturdy to last. Remember at print time that the top part requires support !!

Hint: If you scale it up by a factor of 1.34. Then you have a larger version and you can use M4 screw/nut and a larger spring. Anyway the one showed in the pics is the normal M3 version. If you want a bigger one, you can try using a 1.67 scale factor and M5 screw/nut. If this is still not enough for you... then I challenge you to build the beast, scale it to 2.67 and use M8 screw/nuts (this should be insane insane insane hahaha, maybe you could even carry inside your lunch!!) As FreeCAD sources are included you can customize it to your will. Place a 'remix' with pics if you have a nice idea, I'll be happy to see it.

Hint: I printed mine in phosphorescent ABS to find it easily turning off lights, and also to a better ""after print"" processing. I am thinking about printing it on Ninjaflex but after print work would be crazy...

Hint: If you want it waterproof, just print it with any flexible filament.

Happy BeanBoxing !!!

UPDATE (08-NOV-2015): Added a top part modified to use the beanbox as a necklace in a more convenient way. Added a Open Hardware logo bottom version.

UPDATE (09-NOV-2015): Increased the size of the top into bottom inserting zone to allow a better seal for the waterproof flexible filament print. Unfortunately this forces a bit more sanding in non-flex versions. Anyhow a bit of sanding is required for a perfect fit in those versions.

I downloaded the stl, sliced it with cura and let it print on my cr10 v3. 

Came back after a few hours and it had sucked up a full kilo of filament and only completed 1%. Completely befuddled, I checked the slicer and it was calling for 2.5 kgs of filament and I had infill set to 10%!

No matter what I did, it only wanted to print 100% infill. I finally had to remix it to where it only wanted 393 grams. 

While the failed print was cooling and I was trying to figure out what was wrong with the stl, I started to hear “crick, crick, crick” in the background. Looked at the failed print and tried to lift it off the build plate. It came off alright; it took all the carbundium coating off the glass and it ripped out a big chuck of glass with it! This thing sucked up a full kilo of filament and it ruined my glass plate! If you try to print this, be very careful that it actually prints what you think it will or suffer the consequences. I’m out 40-50 bucks worth of filament, a nearly 100 dollar special glass plate and have nothing but a useless, solid block of plastic to show for it! 

As such,  I cannot recommend this print, which is a shame because the object would be very useful for my Atlas 10F. Buyer beware!This looks great!  What size/model Atlas lathe is this for?Very nice! If I didn't have a quick change gear box I'd definatly print one of these.Hi Mark,

I liked the simplicity and modular way in this storage system.
In my remix, I prolonged the drawers and shells to almost maximum size printable on Ender 3 and to allow more storage using maximum space on shelf. 
In this remix, the shell of drawer is 209.5 mm and drawer includes the handle and additional divider slots.
With labels, I tried to print thin labels, but due to small size of numbers (embossed or cut through the label) it was difficult to print something usable especially for small drawer. Therefore, I decided to label manually on paper (can also be printed out and cut off).
Be patient, the print takes time, e.g. small drawer >6 hours and small shell >10 hours.

Update 6th March 2022: I have added a small drawer option with 4 dividers (each 4 cm apart) for more small parts storage in one drawer (Drawer-Small with handle 4 dividers).",,"['box', 'drawer', 'handle', 'screws', 'storage']",13,406,113,0,0,0,Tools,tool-holders-and-boxes,

To make the best out of a Makerbot 5th generation, i tuned it up with the Smartextruder+ as well as Fleks3D printbed ( i purchased the Replicated 2 5th Gen kit with 2 plates + frame from http://www.fleks3d.com/).

So when i printed a large flat objekt, even the thick Fleks3D warped up and my print failed with filament jams (... thats what every Makerbot 5th gen user is used to. it got better with SE+ but still not ideal).

2016-03-28: Added version v3 STL file. As mine got after a while a little looser I tightened them a little and slanted the uper claw of the clip to make sure that the pressure gets onthe fleks3d plate and not its frame.

So in order to avoid warping, I have created 4 clips that hold the Fleks3D frame as well as printplate in place. 

Hope you find it useful.

I will try this when i get home from work. Feels like a total waste of money just having them laying around.
And not to mention all the bluetape.

Thank you.

good question. actually its fairly simple:

1) forget the puck
2) use a sheet of normal paper for the leveling. a sheet of paper provides enough heat-shielding to the fleks3d so it wont damage it during the course of leveling.
3) to compensate for the sheet of paper, i adjustet the Z-offset by a tick 
4) after the leveling, there is the prime extrusion. sadly thats pretty much on the plastic-frame of flex3d. so have the sheet of paper here and hold it for the priming and pull it away after priming is done. alternatively put a strip of bluetape on the edge of the frame, so the the priming is done on the bluetape and you have to hassle with the sheet of paper only for the leveling.

hope that makes sense
all the bestHere's a weird question. How did you level the buildplate with the fleks3d? 
I bought it a few months ago but can't figure out how to level the buildplate with it. 

When i do the rough leveling procedure it works fine, but when it starts the finetuning and goes down in the middle (home position) and touches the buildplate (The leveling puck in this case) for the finetuning (When it moves step by step) it just keeps going and wont stop. I have to abort the procedure before something breaks. 

First i thought that i could just change the Z-offset but i can only adjust +/- 0,4mm (0,015in,).

Edit* If i do the calibration on the standard glassplate everything works fine.Thank you very much for this creation ;)"

I needed a badge holder that has a RSA key slot and could hold a 2nd card.

A slot was added in the middle to slide in a second card with two offset bars to provide tension so it doesn't fall out. A window was added to the back so you can use a finger to slide the card out. I ran into a small issue of the card getting locked in place but a quick run through the slot with a nail file loosened it just enough to make the inner card slide out easily but not fall out. I dont want to alter the source file because printer tolerances, filament shrinkage, or evil spirits could make it not work, and 2 seconds with a nail file (if needed) is fine for me.

I printed this on a 220x220mm platform using PLA at 190 degrees with 50 degree bed temp.

I did .3 layer and it worked fine. I printed the inner case without brim and edges came up slightly but it did not affect the fit at all, so if you don't feel like cleaning off the brim you can probably get away with printing inner shell without one, same may be true for outer, but I have not tried it

I think you should try printing it with support. The amount of support needed is not a whole lot. In addition, the object is quite heavily built, not a delicate Eiffel Tower. So being a bit rough when removing the support shouldn't break anything. If you have an old screwdriver around, you may consider bending its blade slightly to make it easier to get into the cavity to remove the support.

Can it be printed with support? Or will it be too difficult to get rid of it afterwards?Hello,
just got my auer toolboxes - they are great!

Could You please share Your print settings? (layer height, wall, infill)? Is PLA good enough?
best regardsI just finished printing the parts and I attached them to a piece of plywood, I found out that if I move the center piece back by 1-2 mm it really grabs the box tight. I had it wiggle when I kept it flush with the front of the plywood.Thanks, I will upload a picture when it is finished.Hi sokl, sorry for the late reply. If it isn't helpful for you anymore, maybe for someone else. I printed with PLA. Infill ~ 40%, wall thickness: 1.2mm. Layer hight was 0.3mm. This all works great. The only difficult moment is when the bridges of the four edges are being printed. This is where the flaps of the box will enter. While printing the first layer of that, you may want to be arround and support the bridge manually carefully with a spatula. So that there won't be any hanging strings...

Small parts like resistors just roll under the ""walls"" and get all mixed up.  I wanted something to organize resistors in enclosed compartments.  There are some cool sewing organizers, systems of complete boxes within a larger box, but those solutions are no fun -- they don't involve 3D printing.

The actual containers here are clear plastic test tubes I bought from Amazon, link below.  I've uploaded models for two versions of the tube holder, a single holder and a fiver.  Both styles have connecting holes; just print the ""connector"" model and put them together.  

The connecting holes are d=10mm and to be flush on the back the knobs on the connector straps are h=2.  The knobs are d1=9.25 and d2=9.  While they do pressure fit, I didn't dial them in to truly ""lock.""  My intent was to have them just provide stability for each other while lying in a shallow tool box.  I'd suggest gluing them together permanently if you're going to carry a box around or mount this vertically on a workbench wall, pegboard, etc.

The OpenSCAD file is also uploaded in case you'd like to make connectors that span more than two holders, create 3-packs or 10-packs, whatever you like.

Next step is to find or print a box that a bunch of these will fit nicely in.

You have a choice of a single compartment box or a two compartment box. Two boxes (either ones) fill a compartment in the drawers.

The model wont import in the correct orientation to your slicer (lazy on my part). So you will have to orientate with the base of the box on the machine table.

The holder is designed to hold the wowstick and three of the tube bitholders. I also included a version that has additional side-mounted bitholders to store frequently-used bits in a more accessible manner. I've placed oval holes in the bottom of the mount, so the wowstick with attached bit can be placed face-down, leaving the charging port exposed in the upward direction.

It is important to print both pieces in the upward / vertical direction, so that the layer lines will not impact strength and to avoid thin overhangs. Printing them horizontally is not recommended.

The two pieces have a dovetail joint and should snap together with some force. I've found that the dovetail is sufficient to hold the two pieces together, though if there is any concern, some superglue could be used to ensure permanence.

[In the Onshape project](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/30153ce09d964e859cb04053/w/0d0c148889184c0fa5a9f9f4/e/6c20ccd2d148452eb31aed5c) you can adjust this angle as a variable, as well as the thickness of your plate and a few other parameters. 

Due to the length of the object I intend to hold with the shelf (a soldering station), I later added an variable to offset the start point of the license plate within the bracket outward from the wall, leaving room for a thick power cord to hang.

I've attached two sets of 3 STL files, one set for a shelf that is thinner and closer to the wall, and one set for the thicker, extended brackets. The attached screenshots also relate to these two different versions of the shelf. I haven't yet printed the extended version of the shelf, so the photos are of the thinner version.

I've also exported the project from Onshape in Solidworks, Rhino, and Parasolid formats and have attached them. Perhaps these will allow offline editing. I don't have access to applications that can open those files, so am not sure what is and is not included in them.

4578925,List Defined Tap & Die Organizer,https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/0a/67/e7/ef/9b/large_display_4558f3cf-0777-4e63-9786-80cacd6e565f.JPG,2020-08-24,29,66,2,"This is a list defined Tap and Die Organizer.

DO NOT USE THE STL FILE! I can guarantee that your taps & dies are NOT the same as mine. Edit the list in the scad file to have the dimensions of your taps and dies so this will fit your taps & dies.

I decided I could make something to hold my taps and dies that did not wast as much space as the blow moulded case they came in.

The OpenSCAD program uses a list to define the measurements of each tap and die. Comments describe the items in the list, and there are three examples.

It appears aside from the thread cutting part of the tap, no other part of the tap is standardized, and they will vary between manufacturers. Even within a single manufacturer, the dimensions do not follow any pattern. Measure your own taps and dies and edit the list. Don't assume that my taps are the same as yours or you will be spending 14 hours printing a chunk of plastic to recycle.

I normalized each shaft diameter to the largest shaft of the taps of that screw size I had. This made some taps a bit loose in their holes, but I hope it means that if I break a tap that I will be able to replace it without re-printing the organizer. I also grouped taps into similar sizes, and set their shaft length to the shortest in the group so that there would not be a ragged distribution of heights in the tap organizer.

I used a Brother P-Touch to label the screw sizes and tap types. It would have been nice to emboss this into the plastic, but The text would have needed to be so small, one would have to use a smaller layer height to attempt to make it legible, or if the organizer was enlarged to make the text legible, it would have defeated my purpose in making this in the first place.

Update: I included a position in the Imperial tray for a 20-18 screw size. It appears that I should not have. While I have a plug tap in that size (made by Bay State Tap & Die), numbered screws above 12 were removed from the standard set of screw sizes in the 1900s. I had removed some other oddball taps I had that it is very unlikely that I will ever use, like the 1/4""-32 and the 1/4""-64, but it seems I missed this one. I will remove it if I ever have to re-print this tray.

Update: I have deleted all apps because this requires editing the OpenSCAD design file and editing the list to customize it for your specific tools.

Edit: I revisited this design because I had to buy some more taps & dies. I modified it so that the max diameter is now the diameter of the threaded part of the tap, and the software figures out the largest diameter.
I also found and fixed a bug in the software, I was not indexing the correct part of the list at one point. The software worked for the examples, but did not work with the updated list including the new taps.
I have decided that since tap shaft diameters, shaft lengths and die outer dimensions are not standardized, it does not make sense to include rows for which I currently have no taps or dies. I'll just have to re-print the organizer every time I buy new taps or dies. This was done by commenting out the sections of the list for which I have nothing to go in them.
I also added an option to keep the top of the organizer all the same height. Wastes more plastic, but looks nicer, and makes it easier to grab taps. This was a bit of an after thought, so it does not fit cleanly into the existing structure, but it does work.",,"['openscad', 'organizer', 'tool_organizer']",4,541,179,0,0,1,Tools,tool-holders-and-boxes,You are welcome.

Do you think it'll fit with this version?Just printed this thing and love it. Can you tell me what bolts/screws are required (as shown in your picture?). ThanksGood job! Thanks for adding this to Thingiverse.

So I made this thing and have a couple of suggestions; First one is that the screw holes are beveled on both sides. If one side were simply recessed (a circle) then it could hold a nut.  Second,  with just a small bit of additional plastic you could create a lap joint between the top and bottom rather than a butt joint and the case would self align when you assembled it.

Other than that though, its great.ThanksM3x12mm, either button head or counter sunk head (sits sort of flush).Not familar with FreeCad. With Turbocad I would create a rectangular solid along the seam, probably 2.5 maybe 3 mm thick and aligned with the outside edge, then subtract the base from it, and then add that result to the top of the case. Once done the top of the case along the edge would have a flat edge the width of the bottom, and an overhang (the lap) that was 1/2 the width of the solid you created. 

Looking at the V2 board you might put gaps in it where it would conflict with the taller components but as long as there were a couple of laps along each edge it would align itself when assembled.I tried to keep the case thickness low so that the buttons and USB connector are still accessible - and yet the USB connector is too tight.

It's possible that a short lap joint would work, but I don't know how to model it easily in FreeCAD - do you have any suggestions?"

Hi everybody,

This is just a very simple box to organize my M3.0 screws, bolts and nuts.

Dimensions are 115 x 72 x 25 mm, with 11 cases.

On one side there is an inscription to identify the diameter. 

As i have to organize M2.5 and M3.0, i made two STL files. The upper part is common to both 3.0 and 2.5.

For best results, upper part must be printed upside down.

Enjoy !

I printed a few of them; the sweet spot with TPU seems to be printing at about 103%. That makes the hex bit slots just tight enough that the bits don’t fall out, but loose enough that they’re easy to pull out.   Printing with TPU at 102% works too - the bits just fit tighter, but can still be removed.  (Printed at 100% you can force the bits in, but they are very difficult to pull out without tools.)

NOTE: This bit magazine works perfectly with both short and tall batteries on my Craftsman C3 combo 1/2” hammer drill/driver (model: 315.115800) as well as the Craftsman C3 impact driver (model 315.116060). However, it does NOT fit the older C3 drill/driver (model 315.114852), as that model insets the bit holder clamp by an extra ~6mm or so.  Thanks @perchik, this is great.  I printed it first in PLA, and it fit fine, but since PLA is rigid, the pits were hard to get out.  I printed again with TPU, and it's perfect.   

One note:  I'm using these bit holders with Craftsman C3 drill/drivers, and have noticed that the depth of the inset on the tool varies.  This holder fits my impact driver and lighter weight screw gun perfectly, but one of the other Craftsman C3 units has the bit holder slot inboard about 5-6mm further, so this would need to be adapted to fit that one.  (Once I learn SketchUp better, I'll try to post an updated remix.)"

(2) There is no champfer before the beginning of the threads, meaning there is no feel of the two pieces being lined up before trying to screw the two together.Hi Steve, thank you for sharing your experience.

was modeled using Autodesk Fusion 360, where I designed a modular desk organizer that
can expand in all three axis. 
          This design can help classmates with virtual learning in many ways. Not only is the phone holder excellent for video calls and for display, but the mask holder, cup holder, headphone holder, and tape dispenser help organize things needed for online and in person school. In addition, the large array of pen holders, dishes, and drawers are excellent for organizing anything they would need. 
          I have over 27 different modules, and have compiled a list at the bottom of the summary. The units I use in the pictures and file names are representations of 50mm increments, so 1 is 50mm, 2 is 100mm and so on. I have designed every module to be printable without supports, making the print faster and cheaper. The bottom of each module has holes, and the top of some has a protrusion. The top of one module and the bottom of another will fit into each other, and to connect them, I made some connector pieces that are just the protrusion.

1. One issue I came up against was the tolerances needed to let the connector module and other modules snap together well, and for the drawers to slide in and out of each other. 

2. If I could redesign any part of any module, I would work on the tolerances of the connectors and drawers.

3. 3D printing would help strengthen the design by making it solid (just kidding ;D). 3D printing would help strengthen the design by helping me find flaws and improving the design.

Upgrades:
 Pockets for 4 single bits
 Labels with arrows for Wowstick and Bit holders
 reduced overall lenght by 2mm and repositioned and enlarged magnet holes
 (now: diameter 4 mm, height: 5mm)

I wanted to find a way not having to put the last bit used into its Bitbox, best way would have been to leave it in the Wowstick, but there are no pockets in the original housing and I didn't want it to have it laying crooked in the case.
Therefore I came up with the pockets at the sides, now 4 bits can stay out for direct access.

Mounting tips:
* I used a drywall anchor to mount each bracket to the wall. This works, subject to the usual annoyances and limitations of drywall anchors.
* Update: After ~2 years the drywall anchors I used are starting to loosen up. If I did it again, I would mount some 1x3's into the studs, and then screw these brackets into those.  
* Space the brackets 22cm (on center)
* If mounting multiple cases vertically like I did, I recommend spacing them 15cm to ensure you have enough room to remove them without hitting the bracket above.

The pillars that connect the two outputs are usually plastic parts called supports that support the PCB circuit.
The support is a hexagonal column.
Plastic supports with bolt size M3 can be purchased very easily from parts stores.
You can buy and use M3 bolts and plastic supports that match the width of the tape.

Cutting should be done by cutting off a regular cutter blade.
Since the blade is exposed to the outside, very careful storage and use is required.
It is absolutely not for kids or beginners, so it is recommended for experienced people.

Designed a new side bit holder. It holds 6 bits long or short and uses 6 12x2mm magnets and one M4x6-8mm Cap Head screw. This design is the most secure and gets in the way the least out of all of them. It fits the 2ah and 3ah batteries no problem and should fit all of them. This one does need supports as it prints with the outside face down so the inset screw needs support, for me tree supports work flawlessly so this was no big deal.

This is a complete redesign but I did use the original as inspiration for the back clip and always want to give credit when it is due. All clips use 2 magnets for each hole as I found i wanted lots of strength, but some people might only desire one. Magnet size is 12x2mm. Super glue is needed to hold magnets in. I used M4x6mm Cap Head screws to mount them. 

I print these with lots of walls, nearly solid plastic as they suffer a lot of abuse during use. So far they hold up well.",,"['hex_bit', 'hex_bit_holder', 'ridgid_tools']",4,206,56,1,0,1,Tools,tool-holders-and-boxes,"Thanks, they have been working pretty well but I think I will be trying a new design soon. The side plates are not strong enough to hold things while using the tool roughly although they work well with gentle use(who does that?). The back bit holder works great, but every once and awhile I will hit it hard enough on the right angle to pull it loose. So I am thinking I am going to make the side holders into a 6 bit horz holder system with magnets in the middle. Hoping to maybe work on it today or this week at least depending on how another project goes.

PS. Using a lack table enclosure as well, works great.You beat me to it man! I've been using mine for a several months now and your redesign looks like it solves some of the issues that have cropped up with consistent usage. I've taken my ender 3 apart to encase it in a lack table enclosure, but rest assured that I'll be trying your design out as soon as I get it back up and running!

Instead of cutting a raft to size from a piece of plastic or wood, it was easier to just print one the right size. 

I also decided to would minimize stress on the connector pins and circuit board if I could add support for the part of the power supply module that extends out over the edge of the board. 

The raft works great with the power supply module that I have (I did nip the leads on the underside shorter) but there are several types/designs of the module so if you have one of those then this print will only serve as an example.

I had to print the raft standing vertically to fit on my PrintrBot Play so I used a brim but it will print without if you print it horizontally.

So I took the dimensions from it and implemented them in OpenSCAD to allow for nearly infinite options while still lining up perfectly beside the original ones.

Update 2019-10-24 (1.0.1):
Bugfix: If the diameter was > 35mm and width was large enough to fit more than 1 in the middle row, they were spaced evenly instead of properly fitting between the outer rows.

Update 2019-10-25 (1.0.2):
Added preset diameter for Formula P3. I only have a couple of their washes, but I'm guessing the paint bottles are going to be the same size.

Update 2019-11-15 (1.1.0):
Switched from using total mm width to using bottle count width, with an extra spacing advanced option. Much less fiddly trying to find the right size. If anyone was relying on that for anything, like to match widths across different bottle styles, let me know and I'll make it an option.
Also got some P3 paints, and found my assumption about the paints and washes being the same was _very_ wrong, so added a new set of presets for them.

Update 2020-10-01 (1.2.0):
Added option to add extra height to the bottom to allow for multiple rows of stands.
Added option to chamfer bottom edges to allow for a riser beneath it.
Added Riser scad file to go with the chamfered version. May or may not be cheaper to print a chamfer+riser compared to just printing a taller version, depending on your settings.

It came with a heat shroud for the case and a bent metal standoff for the tip designed to work with the gun on its side (as you can see in one of the pictures above).

The problem is that the sides of the gun is sculpted such that the side is domed out a bit, and the weight is centered on this dome. This effectively turns the gun into an unwieldy and dangerous fidget spinner. The tip standoff is more of a suggestion and the slightest touch sends the gun spinning on its axis.

Hakko does make an upright stand for its soldering pencils (Hakko 633) which also work with the gun, but in practice its not terribly ideal.

684386,Slightly Modified Drawer Box With Hex Pattern Sides,https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/ae/50/49/69/e0/drawer_box_v8_-_hex_pattern_drawerbox_display_large.jpg,2015-02-16,26,36,5,"I modified the version 6 OpenSCAD file to use writecube command instead of simply write so that the text would be centered on the drawer face.   

Added the ability to select from available fonts used by write library for the text on the drawers.  

Also moved the position of the dimple stops so as to not interfere with the drawer dividers as it does in the original design.  With the dimples being in the middle of the drawer the only drawer that would work in the original design would be the single slot drawer.  By offsetting the dimples into the middle of the slotted areas it increases the stops holding the drawer in as well as prevent the divider interference.  

Warning:  

- Something has caused customizer to not take the spacing value being passed to the writecube command.  Not sure if this is specific to another recent change or not.  Compiling locally in OpenSCAD is working correctly.  


Updates:  

- 02/16/2015: Uploaded additional example stl files showing raised text to complement the already uploaded embossed versions.  These are in essence the same as the predecessor thing with the addition of updated dimple stops.  Removed top dimple stops to hopefully help make the drawers not get stuck.  Doing this might lead me to revert to original design and put a single dimple in the middle of the drawer.  
- 02/19/2015: Modified bottom of drawer to have tracks between the bump stops front to back (not yet tested).  
",,['customizer'],10,1942,1888,13,0,3,Tools,tool-holders-and-boxes,"Thanks for that.  I had already fixed it for my slotted box, but forgot to remove the global variables that I guess were deprecated in this one.  I have fixed it now, so you should be good to go.Customizer apparently does not work at all anymore on this?  All I get is 3 sections asking ""Which one would you like to see?"" with dropdowns that don't do anything, so 3 sets of 2 dropdowns and no params to input.

Love your version really bummed that customizer isn't working to do the text, etc. since I'm not adept in the scripting stuff. :(Very cool, great updates!

I'd noticed the issue with the dimple stops, like you say they'd best be offset to the sides to avoid sliding on the divider. I suspect that two stops on the top and one on the bottom would be best.I've gotten the first one of these printed.  I find that the dimple stops might not be a viable option at all, once all drawers are loaded it causes the tolerances to be so tight that opening and closing the drawers becomes more difficult.  Thinking of just having the dimple stops underneath the drawer and not on both top and bottom.Even moving them to the sides is not ideal as they catch on the dividers in the 3 and 4 slotted drawers.  I tried just shaving the dimples off the top of a previously printed drawerbox and it is better, but still snugs the drawer real tight from the bottom.  I think maybe the best situation is to put grooves between the dimples on the bottom of the drawer, that way it acts as guides and stops.  Probably going to make that change in the near future.  I'm not that great with OpenSCAD."

This new bracket design holds 4 panels (one panel is 9x4 boxes in my case )
and all panels can swivel so it is easy to get to the components.

piece that holds it all in place is different depending on if the bracket is
in the top or at the bottom .
Everything was printed on the Creality Cr10s with no support .

Thank you for the feedback .
Yes ,i know that this is not a good solution for everyone ,but when
i created this swivel panel bracket , i did not have any other place
in my lab to have all these tiny boxes and since i rarely use
components from these boxes it solves my problem .
I have all most all of the components on strips/reel ,so for me
it is not a big problem to get them in or out ,though even so  
i do occasionally drop a component because of the
vertical mounting .I'm a bit confused as to the utility of this... after you choose what you want, you're supposed to open the box... but then everything inside the container is going to fall out since it's mounted vertically... how are these supposed to be used exactly? :/"

so, i tried getting whatever ""on shape is"" and it said something along the lines of providing company information, and i am just a dumb dumb guy who has a 3d printer... so i abandoned that route. i imported the stl file into sketchup and your curves and stuff make each item just full of lines. i then tried taking important shapes off the original piece and making my own box out of it (such as the groove for the lid to go into.) and now i'm currently stuck on some way of exporting from sketchup to cura... so it's super late and i'm giving up for the night. but is there an efficient way to take an STL file out of thingiverse into another program (i'm ok with not using sketchup) and being able to properly stretch an item without ruining the ability to use important measurements and without having to edit every single thing every single time?

I have a wooden bar with strip magnets in it that is useful for hanging metallic tools. That is how I used to store these pliers so they were readily accessible. The only problem is that based on how they are made, they don't stick real strongly and can easily get knocked off fall into not easy to retrieve spaces.

Today, I decided to do something about it and built this hanger that is glued to the mag bar with Goop adhesive.  I thought of putting magnets in it, or steel but since I don't need to move it, I decided to just glue it. Now the cutters are safely and securely stored yet easy to access...and they won't fall down.

The design I used wraps over the top of the magnet bar and that is where I put the glue. I am also uploading a version with several 1/4 inch holes for screws, if you just want to screw it onto something. While I am at it, I will go ahead and to a desktop version.

You don't want to design one?!I compared width on both models from Dremel website and the 3000 is about 1 cm thicker so I do not think it would workYou welcome.
I used pla+ and it has been mounted about 4 months. I did not have issues so far with stability. I did not publish some other designs I made to mount tools on Sakdis board but for example, i made a mount for DeWalt drill using pla+ and that one is more heavier than dremel but it is holding so far.Sorry for the trouble.

- Cable for wiring
- 4 x M3 8mm Self trap screws for psu
- 4 x M3 galvanic square nut
- 4 x M3 machined screw

Note: NxTS100 outputs will only have mains power switch, since irons can only start heating by a press of a button on the iron itself, so no need to make the plate more populated and expensive. Aditional you can easy unplug the DC jack from iron if you do not use it...

As a good rule if your team need to use multiple irons at same time please reserve 2.5A per output, 4/6A will feed 2 active irons and 6A/9A will feed 4 irons. But even a weak PSU can work well because irons only peak while cold boot. If your psu can't give the needed amps irons will heat up less quicky.

**14/07/2018:** 5mm width added to station and plates to allow more clearance and the new dual OLED T12 front plate.
Add NOTEXT version to allow clean results with larger nozzles
Station_top upper walls modified to spare plastic, less height and more robust design

**13/04/2018:** SMALLER version added, it reduce case lenght from 160mm to 150mm and height from 65mm to 40mm, it will save about 30% compared with normal version (+/- 2.5h less), a perfect solution for who want only the TS100.

Normally, you just need to print the below 3 items,
a. Cover.stl
b. Bottom.stl - drill through the holes with 2.5mm drill bit, then tap using M3 screw
c. Nipple.stl - need to trim after print

However, if you like to mount it straight onto surface/top of something, just print the spacer.stl instead of the bottom.stl

Other parts you need is M3 screw of at least 12mm long thread.

Some notes/observations/tips on how to print on Ender 3 (using Cura 5.2.1):
1. Adjust Cura settings to remove the prohibited area for the ""bulldog clips"" (there is a vid on YouTube explaining how to do this but it is simply deleting 2 lines of code from one file)
2. Disable the skirt
3. Rotate the part 45 degrees
4. This is will allow the base to print on an Ender 3 without problems
5. The lid will require supports from build plate or flipping over and hoping that layer 2 can stick to the build plate (layer  1 is a small amount of decoration) - it stuck down fine for me.
6. Personally I found the holes in the hinge a bit tight for filament so I used a re-bent paper-clip to be the hinge pin.Isn't it larger than the table of the Ender 3 ?"

They actually work great for larger projects.  


The radial design is really strong, you can print solid if you want and you can print out many more for extra support or even ""scale"" them wider and taller for uneaven surfaces.


Best regards
You beat me to it! I was gonna design some of these. How do these work with such a small base? I planned on making a base with a much larger area (I will use them when staining large pieces of wood), but maybe it's not required to be so big.

I had originally planned to place the punches in the rack with the sharp edge pointing up. After it was printed though, I noticed that a few of the bottom ends had mushroomed ever so slightly from use, but enough to make fitment tight. I thought about filing the edges down, but they'd just mushroom again when I use them. I thought about making the holes larger, but then the punches would rattle around in the rack. Then it dawned on me.. hey moron, turn the punches upside down. Not only do they fit perfectly, the sharp tips are protected and the sizes are visible. That's ok... we all have blonde moments :)

The mounting holes are aligned with standard pegboard spacing (1"" on center) so you can use peg hooks, as I did. The holes are also slotted for easy screw mounting. 

Print in the orientation provided with no supports with a mid-range infill - I went with 40%.

The holder integrated into the grip _provides some advantages_:

*   The hex key for adjusting the pistol grip tilt is always in quick access.

*   Reduces the chance that you may lose or forget a key somewhere.

*   No longer need to be distracted by searching for the key in case you need to adjust (tighten) the grip during training, preparation, or sighting shots.

_[The video][youtube video] is in Russian, but __you may enable English subtitles translated by the author.__ Perhaps in the future, I'll add a video in English voice acting._

__You’ll need:__
---------------------

*   A _hex key_ for screws with hexagonal sockets in their heads, also called an _Allen wrench_ or _Allen key_, or _Inbus_. The key is made in the form of an L-shaped bent hexagonal steel rod. It is better to choose a tool made of high-strength alloy steel: chrome vanadium or chrome molybdenum alloy. A quality tool will not deform and will last for many years. Usually, the low-price hides low quality, which means that not only the key itself may be damaged but also the fastening details.

*   A _pair_ of _miniature magnets_ that can lift and hold a key on weight. 

*   Your preferred _CAD software._ I use the free DesignSpark Mechanical 4.0.

__You can download the form for cutting out the finger recess in the following formats:__
---------------------

*   Solid-state formats rsdoc (DesignSpark Mechanical 4.0), SAB (ACIS), STEP.

*   3D Mesh formats OBJ and STL. In these formats, also available finger recess with rounding of 2 mm radius around it.

An __example of a test model from the video__ is available for download in rsdoc format (DesignSpark Mechanical 4.0). 

If this magnetic holder finds an application in one of your projects, __please share the link. I’ll be very interested to see it.__

Быстроразъемный держатель шестигранного ключа (c пошаговой инструкцией)
=============

[__В пошаговой видеоинструкции по изготовлению быстроразъемного держателя шестигранного ключа__][youtube video] показан способ, __как интегрировать магнитный держатель в ваши проекты__ на примере ортопедической (изготовленной под анатомические особенности кисти руки стрелка) рукоятки спортивного пистолета. Интегрированный в рукоятку держатель _дает ряд преимуществ_:
*   шестигранный ключ для регулировки наклона рукоятки всегда находится в быстром доступе;
*   уменьшается вероятность того, что вы сможете где-то потерять или забыть ключ;
*   не нужно отвлекаться на поиски ключа, если необходимо быстро поправить (подтянуть) рукоятку во время тренировки, подготовки или пристрелки.

__Потребуется:__
---------------------
*   _Ключ для винтов с внутренним шестигранником_, называемый также _инбусовым ключом_ или _ключом Аллена_. Ключ изготавливается в виде г-образно загнутого шестигранного стержня. Лучше выбрать инструмент из высокопрочной легированной стали: хромованадиевого или хромомолибденового сплава. Качественный инструмент не деформируется и прослужит многие годы. Как правило, за низкой ценой скрывается плохое качество, а значит, может испортиться не только сам ключ, но и детали крепления.
*   _Пара миниатюрных магнитов_, способных поднять и удержать ключ на весу.
* _Программа САПР_, в которой вы привыкли работать. Я пользуюсь бесплатной DesignSpark Mechanical 4.0.

__Форму для вырезания углубления под палец можно скачать в следующих форматах:__
---------------------
*   Твердотельные форматы rsdoc (DesignSpark Mechanical 4.0), SAB (ACIS), STEP.
*   Форматы хранения пустотелых трехмерных моделей OBJ и STL. В этих форматах доступны также варианты со скруглением радиусом 2 мм вокруг углубления под палец.

__Пример пробной детали из видео__ доступен к скачиванию в формате rsdoc (DesignSpark Mechanical 4.0).

Если в одном из ваших проектов этот магнитный держатель найдет применение, то __поделитесь ссылкой. Мне будет очень интересно посмотреть.__

The box is designed in such a way that the lid can be put on underneath when you want to have continuous access to the drill bits

Of course, everyone can put whatever they want into the compartments, but I made markings for the most commonly used metric taps and drills for them. M3, M4, M5, M6, M8 and space for smaller drills and bits.

Other ammo boxes of this type  can be found in my Single Spring Latch Ammo Boxes Collection https://www.printables.com/social/261776-brass_ring/collections/176715.

These cartridge boxes are printed as separate parts that are printed in orientations chosen to maximize strength and then snapped together.

The box halves require moderate infill (10%-20%) and can be printed with no supports, but I prefer to paint on supports under the flat sections on the hinge hoops, the latch brackets, and the latch catch. I printed with 0.16 layer height in PETG and PLA.

Check for the latest hinges and latches in https://www.printables.com/model/187176-modular-ammo-box-common-parts or https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5270385.

Assembly instructions:
1) Snap the hinges into the box bottom's hinge hoop making sure that the hinge tabs are fully engaged and locked in place.
2) Flip the hinge tabs to the up position and place the box lid over the box bottom with the hinge hoops over the hinge tabs, press the box halves together until the hinge tabs fully snap into the hinge hoops and lock in place.
3) Push the tab of the latch through the latch hoop on the box lid until the latch tab fully locks in place.

Because if one is with lower capacity...it can go to 13 volts while the other still be at 19 . Also someone can use them without being fully charged. I also think that the stepdown will generate a lot of heat , because current is big. 
 I think that this will be great for use in Angle grinders, trimmers or chainsaw .But the problem is that there the currents will be much higher than a cordless drill.
May be a MOFSET as diode will do the work best. A 10k resistor will make it work but might not be a good idea, i understand a better / proper circuit might be needed to do this properly. Maybe connecting batteries consecutively and then add a DC-DC step-down from 40v to 20v might be better for batteries, but losses are unavoidible in the end. Using diodes will lead to voltage drop . So the tool will think that batteries are 1.X volts lower and will switch off when there is still 25% of the capacity May be there is better solution, and it will require more space.
Also what is the plan to connect the T pin. If you take it from one of the batteries it will not work if there is 1.X lower voltage. May be you will have to cheat it with 10kOhm resistor from the -. The plan is via 2 5A diodes on poisitive battery lines, this is shown in glol's original design, althru i think those diodes are oriented wrong on his design?

4266644,List Defined Socket Tray,https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/8f/31/ec/8c/7f/large_display_DSC04927.JPG,2020-04-07,25,79,7,"This is a minimalist list defined socket tray.

My sockets are all Craftsman sockets from about 20 years ago. Craftsman has used multiple suppliers over the years to make sockets for them, It is unlikely that your set will match mine, so measure your sockets and adjust the dimensions in the list so they match your sockets before wasting plastic printing the wrong size tray.
I included the lists I used to print out my tray's, and left them commented out in the source file. Use these as examples, but don't trust the measurements to match your sockets. I did have to break the 1/2"" drive metric socket tray in two because it would have been too long to fit on my printer bed, even diagonally.

I did not bother making multiple rows align other than inserting fake dimensions for sockets I don't own. If I ever get those sockets, I will probably have to reprint the tray.

Edit: I bought the sockets I was missing, and found that they did not quite fit the holes whose sizes I guessed at. Also, it irritated me that the sockets of the same size did not quite line up, so I updated the socket tables to add in the parts I originally did not have, and correct some minor size issues. I also added two new options ""Align"", and ""Justify"" Setting the variable ""Alignment"" to ""Justify"" will widen the blocks of the shorter rows so that all rows are the same length (this is like right justifying text).  Setting the ""Alignment"" variable to ""Align"" will set the width of an object to the maximum with of all objects in a column, so the parts will line up vertically, even if they are not all the same size.

Va colocada en la parte inferior de la horquilla. Ésta está creada para una Fox38 de 30mm de diámetro interior inferior.
Se puede adaptar para otros diámetros.
La válvula que yo coloco es de la marca Zefal.

He diseñado dos tipos de bases diferentes, una lisa y otra con una ranura para un Oring o junta tórica. Para mí las dos trabajan igual de bien una vez bien apretado el tornillo de cierre. Para un poco más de seguridad extra, la junta tórica agarra un poco mejor. Pero puede ser difícil de quitar después de un tiempo sin utilizar.



Material adicional necesario:

- 1 Tuerca M6


Consejos de impresión:

Relleno (Infill): 60%
Soportes: Sí
Material: Pla o Tpu

La Base(cualquiera de las dos) tiene más resistencia si se imprime en horizontal. Desde plano, girarla a la derecha o izquierda. Con soportes por supuesto y luego es necesario rematarla a mano dejando un acabado bueno. Sobre todo por fuera para que no aumente su diámetro.

El contenedor donde se coloca la bombona de CO2 puede ser necesario darle un poco de calor y acto seguido introducir la bombona para darle el ajuste adecuado.

El aro para la bombona está pensado para colocar entre ésta misma y la válvula, para que al apretar la válvula a la bombona no se apriete y se abra accidentalmente.

It is placed in the fork bottom. Is it for a 30mm diameter Fox38. But it can work well with others by adjusting the diameter.

I designed two different types of bases. One smooth and the other with a groove to use an O-ring. Both works well once the locking screw is tightened. For and extra security the O-ring one is better, but it can be difficult to remove after a while without using.

*ADDED 1/23/19* Mini Version you drop the neck down through. No supports needed.



*Resolution* I was able to print at .25 when prototyping, but .2 is recommended for a cleaner look if that matters to you. 
*Infill* 15-25% The higher the stronger the arms will be. Keep that in mind depending on the size [weight] of battery you are mounting. I've found 20%-25% to be sufficient.
*Supports* I printed without supports which is currently only a problem for the cut out spot on the arms of the original standard size design. It works without supports, but that overhang will be a little sloppy. HOWEVER, V2 NEEDS NO SUPPORTS WHEN PRINTED FLAT HORIZONTALLY ON PLATE.
*Orientation* Versions with text were printed vertically with the text side against the plate. The rest horizontally with bottom to plate.

Now if you use Fusion 360 you can use that as the start of your project. Please just list this as the source for a remix if you do!

I love the [pegboard 2 position blank](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:271157) by [twobraids](https://www.thingiverse.com/twobraids) and often use it as the start of a new thing, but I often find working with it frustrating as it has a very slightly odd shape. There are a number of angles that look to be right angles but are ever so slightly inclined, and things that look like they should be planar are ever so slightly not planar. It gets frustrating quickly, so I decided to take the key dimensions and redo the part from scratch so it's easier to work with.

All the dimensions _(on the SketchUp version)_ are the same, lifted directly from the original, and the profile of the top pegs are also lifted directly from the original and are the same thickness. If you print the two, they'll be visually identical, but the key difference is what looks like a 90 degree angle actually is 90 degrees, and what looks like a planar surface is actually planar. The bottom pegs are also sized so that the support material only from the top of those pegs - at least in Cura. I also did away with the round at the top of the piece, as that would be easy to add if needed, and if it's not, you've got a good top surface for working with.

For the Fusion 360 version, I took some measurements off my SketchUp version, but then ran a couple test prints to optimize the fit. Since it's fully parameterized, you can adjust if necessary to get the right fit on your pegboard.

 *  Make the outer surface a smooth curve, (and a circular base to match)
 *  Make the top surface smooth instead of a staircase

Okay finally got around to updating the size of the charger hole. When I designed V2, I didn't account for the expansion of the PLA material once it's printer. You have to allot for roughly the same layer thickness extra, so that everything fits. So now I've increased the size of the back charger hole by 15-20% so we should be totally good to go. I'm going to finalize this file. Please let me know any feedback, comments, or ideas for upgrades.

Cheers!

Watch a Timelapse video of this thing being printed (took 4.5 hours): https://youtu.be/8B69rLBJfes

Just uploaded a real photo of the dock, holding my 4 juice pods and the JUUL vape itself. It actually looks and performs REALLY well! I'm super happy with it, with the exception of the charger hole... I'm going to keep this as a work in progress for now, until I fix the size of the charger hole in the back. For now, imagine you can't use the charging feature until I fix the height of the hole. Everything else works great though, so feel free to print and give it a try. It's pretty compact, light, and easy to carry around from room to room. 

****UPDATE:****

07/18/18 

So yesterday I printed this file for the first time. I thought I had my measurements all right, but I guess I jumped the gun on uploading to Thingiverse. After it had finished printing, I realized the pods would fit, but the actual vape itself didn't fit... neither did it's charger. lol

So I just whipped up a modified version. Because I had to scale the triangle out a bit on the Y axis (to make the charger fit) I was able to add a bunch more pod holders. Now the dock can hold 26 pods instead of 18, and it should work perfectly with the charger and the vape itself. 

I'm currently printing the new version. Will be done in about 5 hours. I will post the result as soon as I can. For now, the mockups and the STL file are the new version (V2) but the actual printed photos are still showing the original (until V2 is done printing, then I will replace them.)

My JUUL Vape arrived today and while it was charging I started sketching my first charging dock/pod display. Designed it in Tinkercad (LOVE!)

This will hold and showcase up to 18 pods as well as the vape itself. I've also created an opening in the back that will allow you to slide in the charger dock. So in other words, this dock can also be a charging dock when you feel like it - or always. 

I really like the triangular design, I feel like it would make a nice addition to a desk, counter, bookshelf, entertainment unit, drawer etc. Print a couple and put them in different places!

Note that this is NOT intended to forcefully retain the meter. It's intended for ""lab"" style conditions where the meter will remain largely undisturbed while hung. It is thus intended for easier removal of the meter, not secure retention of it. Capiche?

Question: Why do I have 3 work lights?
Answer: I need a third work light before I can have a fourth one, of course.

To make the work light portable, I matched it up with a Makita 18V LxT battery.  The design is modular, so if you're handy, you could switch the battery mount for your preferred battery eco-system.

The individual parts have some weight to them, so I added a 3mm steel bracket as a frame to the light housing frame.  A 3mm steel is a bit of an over kill, but I worked with parts I could easily get.

The work light is very bright, so I included high and low brightness modes.  To provide the low light brightness mode, I included an LM2596 DC-DC inverter with an output voltage adjusted to about 11V.  The power switch has 3 positions, On-Off-On, switching between the high, off and Low brightness.

On high, the light delivers 4600lx at 0.5m.  The light uses 24W, so should last about 3.5 hours on a 5A battery.  I have the low brightness mode set to 10W, so expect the light to last 9 hours between charges.

The fog light is available through Amazon for about AU$60 (sold in pairs).

I hot glued magnets to the base to help secure the bits. I was wondering if a small bump in the hex hole would provide enough resistance to secure them, but didn't have time to test that since I tried a few already!

Pegboard system I designed and have been using for about a year now. I will admit I got some of the design ideas from Thingiverse and browsing the web, but the one thing that drove me crazy about the designs was how they worked with PLA and my printer.

Here are some things I tried to fix in my design process:

Simplicity in design.
Designed the pegs to not break easily and fit the holes without being to tight on the top row. This is where I saw most of my breakage.
Added extra supportive pegs to help support weight, align pegs better, and they are good to have with the support structure printing.
Added bottom level stepper pegs to some structures so they sit better on the pegboard and not slant.
Placed locking pegs on hooks and some other smaller designs so they do not pull out of the pegboard when removing tools.
Kept all the backs on hooks flat so they sit flush against pegboard and not wobble all over and with the locking pegs they are perfect.
I will continue to add more to this system and maybe upload more images and explain some of the design ideas more in-depth in the future.",,"['caliper', 'caliper_holder', 'digital_caliper', 'pegboard', 'pegboard_adapter', 'pegboard_hook', 'pegboard_mount', 'pegboard_tools']",2,171,80,1,0,0,Tools,tool-holders-and-boxes,

2018 version: 53 mm (h) x 72 mm (w)

2014 version: 48 mm (h) x 72 mm (w)

Length is irrelevant as the two pieces are independent.Do you have the dimensions of the 2014 and 2018 EVSEs?

I would appreciate that because comparing the 3D models I only get the outside dimensions of the model themselves. It should be compatible with the 2014 version.

I got many parts in small amounts, so I decided to build boxes, which fit 2, 3 and 4 times in the original box. I build a ""6 time box"" as well, but you can't handle it usefully, without empty the whole box or using tweezers.

Ich habe mir einen Sortimentskasten mit zahlreichen Schubladen für eine Wandmontage gekauft. Jede dieser Schubladen kann mit einer „Trennkarte“ unterteilt werden. Bis zu drei Unterteilungen pro Box sind möglich. Fünf „Trenner“ sind im Lieferumfang enthalten. Sie lassen sich in 10er-Paketen nachbestellen für etwa 3€ pro Stück. Das ist für mich nicht tragbar, da das Sortiment 36 Schubladen umfasst, von der jede theoretisch dreifach unterteilt werden kann.

Da ich elektronische Bauteile für Wiederverwendung aus alten Geräten auslöte und aufbewahre, möchte ich sie vernünftig sortiert wissen. Zunächst designte ich einen dieser „Trenner“, musste aber feststellen, dass das kein für mich gangbarer Weg ist. Ich erstellte also Boxen, die in die Schublade des Sortiments passten. So kann ich eine Box einfach entnehmen und alle auch einzeln beschriften. <- Das ist in meinem Fall sinnvoll, da ich die Boxen noch mit Barcodes beschriften und einer Software katalogisieren werde.

Durch das Auslöten habe ich viele Teile in kleinen Mengen und ich entschied mich deswegen, zwei, drei oder vier kleine Boxen in eine Schublade zu packen. Ein kleineres Design ist kaum mehr sinnvoll, da man es schlecht entnehmen kann und die Teile entweder auskippen oder mit einer Pinzette entnehmen muss. Man kommt schlichtweg mit den Fingern nicht mehr in die Box. Zu klein. – Ein Design mit vier Boxen ist möglich. Dazu mehr weiter unten.

Den Sortimentskasten habe ich für wenige Euros bei Hornbach gekauft. Der Kasten selber hat keine Angabe eines Herstellers, sondern trägt lediglich das Prädikat: „Made in Germany“.

Ich habe diverse Box-Sets designt: Neben dieser „2er-Box“ gibt es noch eine „4er-Box“ und eine „3er-Box“. Dies ist das Design für die 3er-Box.

Lockbox for simply locking something away. Lighters or keys, for example.

I added my favorite text on top of the lid to provide more grip for slide open. If you've removed the support from groove properly, it will work easily without text, too.

For easy removal of support, choose an angle of 45° offset to border: Than you'll be able to put a tip of a small srewdriver between the gaps, to pull the support out of the groove.

Otherwise the groove will be covered with a ""support-wall."" Depending on the used material, you'll get a workload preview, if you have to break up the lockbox.

With PLA PLUS you'll get a lockbox with 15x higher impact strength than ABS, with the same advantages of regular PLA while printing.

I was looking for a decent mount for my smart-home raspberry pi for DIN rail.
However there were none that included cooling. 
That is why I made an attempt to design my.


### It's not perfect in a few ways:

* Some versions of RPI sit perfectly on Standoffs, some don't. For my Asus tinkerboard I had to cut / shorten mounts near holds so it would fit
* Most of cases that i've seen have you insert RPI to the half of case - so MicroSD hole can be made of corresponding size. This one doesn't - I have 2 parts - box and cover. Save yourself some money - remove microSD and insert carefully from MicroSD side.
* I am using blue radiator that is used in 3D printing which fits fine on top of chip. If you have some bigger one - you would have to use pliers to remove top cover parts.



### Things that you might need to buy

Here are name of things that I've bought from Aliexpress - so you don't have to search (use same name for amazon):
* din rail (you should already have it, otherwise this design make no sense - local retail have it for $1.5)
* silent cooling fan 5015 (12v is enough - it would be quiet enough or 5v if you want mega cooling) https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32876145149.html
* (optional) M2.5 M3 Copper Inserts Brass Double Pass Knurl Nut Embedded Fastener https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32842866575.html

I refined the design a few time to end up with this where the label is recessed 2mm from the top to allow the partition holders in the carryall to hold the containers in place without the label interfering with the lid of the carry all.

Thanks for the great design! Printed up really nice on my Ender 3 in about 8 hours with red Overture PLA.

I'd recommend on a future mod to include positive snap type closures on the lid to preclude it's accidental opening and spilling the contents. Regards,
EdI like the red.  For some reason I kept using the Duramic3D blue that's close to a Dillon's color for the comparators (Hornady, red) and cartridge gauge set (L.E. Wilson, yellow).  I like the idea of the box tabs, I'll have to look at modifying the design some and see if smaller tabs are FDM printable and durable.  Mine are also looser, but I wasn't sure about everyone's print tolerances, so it's a couple tenths of a millimeter larger for clearance."

The spindle is an 80mm 2.2kW water cooled spindle and the ring attaches to the collar (narrower and black) at the bottom of the spindle. 

I also needed a hood which serves two purposes.  It helps direct the airflow from the cooling fan onto the cut/engrave point which helps clear any smoke and helps prevent burning along the edge of the cut.  In truth it does not work nearly as good as a high power airjet right in at the cut but it's better than just the fan blowing over the cooling fins.  The second purpose is to act as a shroud and helps stop laser light from bouncing all over the place.  Let me be clear !!!THIS DOES NOT REMOVE THE NEED FOR THE CORRECT SAFETY GLASSES!!! when using lasers.  The hood should just slide fit over the heatsink.

I also included some brackets to hold the driver board.  Before printing you need to check your lasers dimensions to see that this will fit.  Mine is 40mm x 40mm.  The heatsink is 52mm from base to the start of the fan.  Many of the commonly available laser diode modules of this power will have similar dimensions.  The hole spacing on the rear plate should be 20mm x 40mm  There may be a fifth hole on yours which you dont need to use.

The driver board bracket fits a board with a heat sink width of 47mm.  You need to print two of these.  This whole package allows me to quickly switch between using my laser and other tools and indeed the spindle itself very quickly.  The ring locks in place with an M5 nut and bolt, Just hand tighten.

Lastly a great addition you can add to your laser setup is an airjet right in at the cut point.  I've included a pic of mine which is simply a small metal tube bent and zip tied to the hood.  Its attached via some silicone tubing to my airbrush compressor.  Be sure to crush the end of the tube tight to increase the airflow speed out the end.  To illustrate the difference I attach another pic showing the difference air-assist makes.

Hope you find some of this useful.",,"['cnc_laser', 'spindle']",3,448,1127,0,0,1,Tools,tool-holders-and-boxes,"Thank you for sharing the design.

3981825,Vallejo Type Paint Bottle Rack v3 (Some Gussets),https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/40/96/2f/2e/e6/large_display_vallejorackv3.STL,2019-11-17,22,39,2,"A remix of a remixed alternate version of the original haha

•Shortened the rack to 4 slots to fit my printer. I think it makes some sense too, you can put a base, highlight and shade on a rack and the 4th slot can be a wash or brighter highlight or whatever.

•I'm using stiff ABS-like resin and don't actually need any of the gussets, but I like the look of them so I left 3 on there.

•Minoosh uses the racks flipped around (the gussets are like supports for a shelf), but I like them better this way. Screwheads won't get in the way of the caps since I'm using doublesided tape to mount them.

Another idea is to make the gussets modular, they would be printed separately with pegs attached, then small holes would be added to the rack between the bottle slots where they can be pegged in. They could serve as dividers.

•After adding supports, each rack ends up costing only about 25 cents. (Assuming $40 for a 1000ml bottle.)

•The normal Vallejo bottles' necks fit snugly in the slots, they won't be falling off the wall unless Bigfoot rams the building (the monster truck, not the cryptid).

•The empty Vallejo bottles will NOT fit though, that was a bummer. They're shaped more like bullets and simply don't have any neck to work with.

I made my own version of the base for the Bosch GO 2 electric screwdriver. The screwdriver can be positioned vertically or horizontally. Also, the bits and screwdriver are fixed to the base tightly enough to be used during transport.
In the bit storage compartments, I installed the 2.9 mm diameter ball magnets that I had in stock. Each cell has two such magnets. The magnets are easily pressed into place one by one.
You can use your magnets in other sizes by changing the model . I attach the Fusion 360 project.
You can also use this base without using magnets.
If you are going to use magnets, it would be worth going through the bit holes with a 7.5 mm drill to make it easier to remove the bits. Be sure to drill AFTER installing the magnets in the cells, so as not to damage the model. It is better to do it manually, without using a drill.
If the drill does not pass, the cells will be dense enough that the bits do not fall out even without magnets.

Привет!
Я сделал свой вариант базы для электрической отвертки Bosch GO 2. Отвертка может находиться в вертикальном или горизонтальном положении. Также биты и отвертка закреплены на базе достаточно плотно, чтобы можно было использовать это при транспортировке.
В отсеках для хранения бит я установил шаровидные магниты диаметром 2,9 мм, которые у меня были в наличии. В каждой ячейке два таких магнита. Магниты легко запрессовываются на свои места один за другим.
Вы можете использовать свои магниты других размеров, изменив модель . Проект Fusion 360 я прилагаю.
Также можно использовать эту базу без использования магнитов.

These trays were made for the DeWalt 42-Piece 3/8-Inch Impact Socket Set (DWMT19248), but would probably fit similar sets from other companies such as the Neiko 44-Piece 3/8-Inch Drive Impact Socket Set 02440A. The trays are for the sockets only, not the extra extensions, joints, etc.

The beauty of SCAD is you can easily customize everything to fit your sockets. If you want to make trays for other socket sets check out the design this is remixed from, you can find out more there.


FILES
I am including both SCAD and STL files for each tray, so that you can easily customize the socket sizes as needed. The holders are as follows:

Metric 8mm - 18mm
Metric Split 8mm - 14mm
Metric Split 8mm - 14mm [Height adjusted to match 15-19mm]
Metric Split 15mm - 18mm
SAE 5-16in - 3-4in

My printer could not fit the full 8-18mm set in one piece, so I split it up into two. By splitting it up the two part’s heights do not quite match, so I added a height adjusted version if you want to use a little extra material to have them the same.

There is a small recess for the well nuts such that the holder will be perfectly flush against the panels.  The cross shape of the holder allows you to align your bits in whatever orientation you want.  It may possibly work with bits from other multi-tool brands, but I've only tried it with ones from Milwaukee for my M12 FUEL multi-tool so I'm not really sure how standard the pattern is across other brands.

This should in theory work for any 0.25"" pattern pegboard as well.  The bits are very lightweight so print orientation and settings really aren't all that critical.  You do need to be careful when grabbing blades from the holder to pull them straight outwards, otherwise you may end up using them essentially as a lever which may break your holder.  

Well nuts are overkill since you don't really need that much strength, but I just like my holders to be nice and tight up against the panels.

These differ from the original models here (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4555934) since they have a sliding indicator which displays if a battery in the holder is charged or discharged, they are otherwise very similar.

<strong>These models have the following features:</strong>

* Models for Extended 20V batteries.
* Mounting holes to use with #8 screws (non pegboard versions).
* Versions for mounting on 1"" peg board (with pegs which you can optionally use #6 x 1/2"" or M3 screws to better secure the holder into the peg)
* Versions with a clip for storing the charger.
* Charger storage versions have built in cable management guides.
* Holes in the bottom of the holders for possibly better airflow (my extended batteries have vents in this area).
* Sliding battery indicator.

<strong>To determine which file you need, the files are named according to the options they include, for example:</strong>

<strong>BD-20V-Battery_Holder_V44_IND_EXT_CHARGER_PEG.stl</strong>

<strong>REG</strong> = Regular Size Battery
<strong>EXT</strong> = Extended Size Battery

<strong>CHARGER</strong> = (yes or no) has a clip for holding the charger

<strong>PEG</strong> = (yes or no) mounts on a 1"" peg board


If not using the pegboard mounts use #8 screws for mounting.



<strong>Note that the inserts are not the same, and the one used will depend on the model of the holder you are printing.</strong>  The inserts are named so you can identify which works with which model, for example:

BD-20V-Battery_Holder_V44_EXT_CHARGER_INSERT.stl

would work with either:

BD-20V-Battery_Holder_V44_IND_EXT_CHARGER.stl 

or 

BD-20V-Battery_Holder_V44_IND_EXT_CHARGER_PEG.stl



To assemble the indicator, I used gel super glue to attach the red and green indicators to the insert (see pics), then install the slider with the springy tab to the bottom.  I found it was easier to install the slider and set in place first, and then install the insert with the indicators glued to it.  There is enough friction that it should not be necessary to glue the insert in, but it can be done.  If you don't have red and green filament, you can just print the indicators in white and color them with a sharpie (I did that in the test print in the pics and the colors turned out pretty good).  

For a more secure mounting on the pegboard, you can optionally install #6 x 1/2"" or M3 x10mm screws in the holes which go through the pegs.  Note that it is possible you could damage the holes in your pegboard by screwing the holders down through the pins.  I have installed and removed these without damage to my pegboard after using the #6 screws to lock the pins in place, but I was careful to work them out when removing.  If concerned, you may want to try testing the pegboard pins with screws in an obscure location first with the screws you plan to use and try M3 screws instead of the #6 screws which are a bit larger - or omit the screws all together.  


If you are just needing a charger holder, I made one you can find here:

The STEP file is included for easy remixing.

Parts are not oriented for printing, but I suggest printing them in the tall orientation (same way they would be mounted on the wall).  Supports are required for the pegboard versions.

I made the top from T-Glase (supplied by 3DPrintergear.com.au) so I could see thru it - I think It could be thinner - I've supplied the Viacad files for reference.  

Enjoy","Make the box with 1 shell 10% fill 0.27 height of the ABS color of your choice.  
Make the lid out of something translucent so you can see thru it I used T-Glase but the Translucent colors will work to I used 1 Shell 5% fill with 0.27 layers.  
If you peel the top of the heated build plate a bit early (while its warm) you get a natural curve in the top which holds it snugly when closed. There are also lips on the outer edge of the box slide which can be modified if they are to big or grippy",[],4,846,1191,0,0,0,Tools,tool-holders-and-boxes,

I simply took his idea and modified it to fit more common razor blades.  I also am including the AutoCad dwg file.  I made mine out of 1/4 inch acrylic and I love these things.  Gone is my honeycomb table.  No more is the occasional discoloration you get when the laser gets to the edge of the honeycomb table and is just a little too hot and melts the material you are working with.  Plus you can see so much better what you are working on.  I usually have around 6 of these little guys floating around on the bed at any given time or less if the material is smaller and I need to see around. ,Simply laser cut these out on your laser cutter.  I am using a Full Spectrum 40W hobby laser 4th generation.  I use 25% speed 100% power to cut these little guys out.  I will say this I WOULD NOT USE THIS IN A PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT WHERE I WAS NOT THE ONLY PERSON USING THE LASER.  I REPEAT DO NOT USE THESE AROUND CHILDREN OR PEOPLE WHO LACK THE INTELLIGENCE TO WORK WITH RAZOR BLADES FACING YOU.  They can be dangerous but so can your laser so if you can't work with razor blades you probably should bot be running a laser in the first place.  So I am sure all of you can handle it right?  With that said the advantage of using these far out way the danger if you can deal with that warning.  Give them a try my guess is you wont go back to your honeycomb table I know I won't.  Thank you Plasma2002 I know you have gotten a lot of flack over these guys but you made a believer out of me.,[],1,713,3224,0,0,0,Tools,tool-holders-and-boxes,

Toilet paper is smaller and less wasteful than paper towels when you only need a small cleanup, so I like having a roll handy by the bike stand. The original design was okay but not perfect, so I redesigned it from scratch.

This holder addresses the issues I had with the previous holder, and has a better overall fit. The flip-up holders can't flip _all the way_ up so won't get stuck vertical. I think it also looks a little nicer than the old design.

One note - this was designed with a uniform 0.2mm clearance all the way around. I'm constantly being told that my designs ""don't work"" and my only guess is when they work for me and not for you, you very likely have a printer that isn't properly calibrated.

I used ANSI specified shank diameters to size the holes for taps.

Clearance Drills go in the center row when looking at the object from either the ""FINE"" or ""COARSE"" side.

When looking at the object from the ""COARSE"" side, place tap drills in the row of holes closest to the markings (1/2-13, 7/16-14, etc.). Then place the taps in the row of holes between the ""COARSE"" tap drills and the clearance drills.

3.- Necesitaba albergar un boton pulsador (12x12mm)  para Shutdown/Reset de la Raspberry Pi.

This is fun.Sorry, I should have better explained myself. I mean, what is the purpose of attaching a Realsense D400 to a Quest?Thanks for your comment.
Does point mean features?
If so, there are three points: 
- the simple design that does not detract from the appearance of the HMD, 
- the minimal structure that saves material, and 
- easy installation and removal of the Realsense camera.

Does my answer make sense? Just curious, what would the point of this be?

yes, they are the same thing. As I wrote in the description there is one ""complete"" STL file and two ""separated"" ones which need to be glued together after printing. After glueing the two separated parts together they are the same thing as the complete one. It depends on your printer and slicer which variant suits you better.

At first I printed the complete STL but the quality of the charger plug holder was not as good as expected (bad support I guess). So I separated the charger plug plate from the rest of the body for my second print which turned out to be much better in my case.

As it still isn't visible for me I've uploaded it also to directupload:

The plug holder has been split into two parts, so it is much thinner in ""part 1"" and also doesn't contain the sinking. Hope that makes it clear for you.Hello!
 I think I understand you're intention, but I'm still confused. ""complete"" and ""Part 1"" look the same for me, apart from the difference in file sice. Both have the plate to hold the plug. Nevertheless according to the slicer there must be some difference I cannot see?"

This was annoying as I could never find the correct sized socket, so i thought, i have a printer, this has been an issue for far too long...skip through days and days, and 10+ revisions, and bam, you have yourself a socket tray, yea its not perfect, as outlined below, but it does the job, and I am not wasting anymore filament on this.

The filament was changed out to create the text.

SO, what can you improve.

1. The 11mm and the 7/16 could be tighter, as the wavy radius around the bottom inner edge is a bit loose.

2. The universal socket and the 2"" extension are a bit close, and a little difficult to remove, not quite sure how i'd fix that, maybe reducing the depth of the cutout so it sits higher, as they are very close and getting my average sized index finger between the 2 is a bit tight, ill see how i go in the future and may come back to it if it creates enuff headache.

3. The ratchet cutout is a little off, we'll see how it pans out, looks to the job ok.

4. theres a tiny gap between the frame and the tray, approx 1mm. I might make a shim, but it doesnt affect the operation, and it doesnt flop around as the outboard edges make good contact with the edges, but at the inboard is fractionally smaller for whatever reason. 

5. I was going to make a dowel to sit inside both halves so they could be glued together, but there wasnt much left over room, I might just glue them together skipping the dowel.

Attached is the sketchup file, I used sketchup, which is prob why it took so many revs, really should learn solidworks, esp since i have it.

With this design I am able to contain tiny #2 washers and invert the box and give it a shake without anything falling out. The nubs on the lid of the Stanley box should press down on the lids and keep the chambers closed.

I turned the Initial Layer Flow Rate down to 80% to avoid overextrusion on the first layers of the lids and get a good fit. 

Changes:
- This is a full replacement bin, it doesn't slip inside one of the bins that comes with the organizer. Since @registeredthing's original was almost an entire box within the bin, this doesn't use much more filament to print. Additionally, there is no need for double sided tape to hold it in place and the parts inside are fully contained. A large fillet at the bottom helps your fingers slide small parts up the walls so you can grab them.
- I replaced the hinge mechanism. This remix uses a piece of stripped 22AWG solid core wire as the hinge. To ensure this prints correctly, use 0.25 layer height and make sure the body piece has 4 layers across the hole and the lid pieces have 5. This is shown in the pictures above. The hinge can open just past 90º so it will stay open. EDIT: I also found some 20 AWG nichrome wire laying around that works well for the hinges and is stiffer than the copper.

This 3D print provides a tray that my sockets sit in. The sockets are easy to get out and to replace. Each socket hole has an adjacent socket size label making size selection even easier.

To make the print result more interesting, I do a filament colour swap near the end so that the raised text is printed in another colour and make it more visible. The filament colour swap is setup in your slicer software. Setting up the filament colour is easy in PrusaSlicer, other slicers probably, too.

The die trays fit a standard 1"" diameter die perfectly, and also do a good job of holding a 13/16 die.

This is just a smidge too wide to fit two side-by-side in a standard 23"" tool chest drawer. Sorry - it needed to be that way to fit all the tools I had. 

I used pretty standard print settings - The pictured trays were printed at 0.2mm, though I don't see any reason you couldn't go up to 0.3 or 0.4 -- The walls between the die-trays might suffer a bit, I suppose... I didn't do anything special with the infill - 25% grid. This took a LONG time to print, but I wanted it to be a fairly sturdy and clean...

It will also divide the glove compartment into two areas, one big enough to fit napkins, one taking up the rest of the space. This is in part for organizational benefits (the smaller one will be perfect for the ketchup packets and such), and because a bin the full size of my glove compartment is bigger than my print bed anyway.  

The bin is not as deep as the glove compartment because the door bumps against it as it closes. The bottom is latticed to minimize curling.

## Wall Mount for Meter Pole + Pica-Dry ##

Wall bracket (for screwing) for plastic meter stick + Pica-Dry.
The wall bracket consists of 2 components (lower bracket + upper bracket)

##Assembly##
First mount the lower bracket. It fixes the desired height
Then mount the upper bracket at a distance of 60mm. Then the Pica-Dry pin visually centers in the middle of the meter stick. The pin and meter bar can be removed upwards.

Cut-out inside measure (meter bar) 34 x 17mm
So suitable for meter bars of 33 x 16mm
I use the plastic meter stick LongLife+

You can use the lower part as a stand alone wall mount.

This is a nice little tool which has many uses on bikes, so it's handy to keep it near. This thing is a simple pegboard mount for the Torqkey.

You'll see the one I have in the photo doesn't have the glued-in 4mm hex bit. If you have one and want to use other bits, use a heat gun to warm the end holding the 4mm hex bit and you should be able to pull out the bit. Clean out the glue however you can, and you've now got a 5Nm preset torque wrench which will take any 1/4"" drive hex bit. The only problem is they won't stay in on their own. To fix this, I used a 6mm drill bit and ran it into the end, clearing out a little bit of built up glue and such, then stuffed in 6x3mm rare earth magnets until they wound up at the right height to hold a bit.

(The base in the first photo is on my TS-2 which I bought in 1992. Got to love Park durability!)

So, I took my TSB-2 and took some measurements, and then duplicated just the spoke holder in Fusion360. It'll hold four spoke wrenches, but you could modify it for more or less with the F3D file, just change the number in the pattern. This is sized for the standard Park spoke wrenches, such as the ubiquitous [SW-0](https://www.parktool.com/product/spoke-wrench-sw-0). It probably won't fit the [SW-20.2 Master spoke wrench](https://www.parktool.com/product/master-spoke-wrench-sw-20-2) but wouldn't be too hard to modify it. I personally prefer the classic SW-0 to the fancier SW-20, and that's what we've got at the shop as well.

I recently bought a new soldering iron on amazon, and took one of the cheaper ones, which kept coming back with good reviews. 

The stand that comes with it is pretty bad, so I wanted to create a printable stand of my own with a holder for the sponge, iron cleaner, wire spool and various tips. 

Here is the result!

I'm not completely satisfied by how much friction I'm getting so I may update it in the near future after I've used it for a while.

This model is designed to hold your paint brushes vertically, tip down. You will need a rubber band (the one I used is 210mm long) and some extra 1.75mm filament in addition to the parts here.

Note: Many printers will over-fill the holes for the filament to feed through. This depends on many factors (cooling, material used, extrusion temperature, printer calibration). It's easy enough to print as is and then take a 1/16 drill bit to clean out the holes in the enclosure, cover, and clips.

Print all the parts without supports. You will need 16 clips, 1 base, 1 enclosure, and 1 cover. Cut 16 pieces of filament about 20mm long (minimum of 10mm but having them longer is easier to work with). Before starting, it's useful to put a rock in the center of the base to make it more stable and easier to operate single-handed. It is a bit tricky to set up, but you need to feed the rubber band through the hole and wrap it around two of the clips. Use a piece of filament through the clip and into the base. I found it easiest to have the filament flush with the top of the clip and sticking out the bottom of the enclosure. Don't worry that they don't stand vertically yet, that will be straightened out after you have all the clips in place.Then carefully put he cover onto the enclosure. To get the cover on, rotate it about 10 degrees, put it on, and rotate it into position. Then use the filament sticking out of the bottom of the enclosure to rotate the clips into place and push through to the top. You can trim the excess filament when you're done.",,"['paint', 'paintbrush', 'paintbrush_holder', 'paintbrush_organizer', 'paintbrush_stand']",4,253,58,0,1,0,Tools,tool-holders-and-boxes,

Actually I wanted to make the original parts. But I had two problems. First the bearing did not go into the platform.stl and second, the handle.stl (printed with 20 % infill) broke at the first use as can be seen in the pictures. Just scaling up the platform probably wouldn't work because the outer diameter might have been to large to turn in the ground part.

So both parts are completely new constructs. The new 'handle' is easier to print and stronger. The ground.stl here is a copy from the original design. 

I have printed all parts without using support but I suggest to use support for the platform.stl or you have to rework the hole for the bearing. For the other two parts there is no need for support.

As in the source already mentioned there is not really a need for, or a benefit from the bearing but it gives it a more technical touch and keeps the two parts together ;-)

. Screwdriver holes
. Additional peg e.g. for tweezers

1) the actual Tool holder
2) a TPU sleeve as ""vibration dampener""

If you do not have access to TPU (or any other flexible material) I have attached a file with the One-part-design so you can print it as one piece.

I advice using Tree-supports for the Spatula-Slit. The other holes do not need any support, therefore you can use support blockers in these areas.

#### All dimensions are given in millimeters

Note: I am currently adding my repertoire to thingiverse when I have spare time, so the collection will get more items. 

####Dimensions used in the designs (All my designs are designed to be snug fit to the given dimensions):
- Distance from center to center of the holes: 34 mm
- Hole size: 9.85 mm (manufacturer spec is 10mm)
- Plate thickness: 1.8 mm.


### Why make your own?
The square hole tool choice is sparse, as the round holed pegboards are obviously the most used.
I just wanted my tools hanging and had some goals to call it a success:
- It must work reliable and NEVER accidentally fall out by itself.
- It must be a snug fit, as I want it to stay in place and not wobble around.
- Minimal post processing - if any at all.... I hate post processing

### Versions
I have tried to name the files with the info needed to make a choice.


### Hardware
None, as the lock is 3D printable.

### Printing notes
Some parts needs supports (I have tried to remember to add SUPPORT to the name of the items needing support..
I have placed all parts in the best printable orientation for strength/printability.

### Assembly notes
See youtube clip here: [Assembly and disassembly instructions](https://youtu.be/TMC4TadyGks)
The tabs goes into the hole(s) and is then pressed down to latch onto the pegboard.
I have designed a lock to put into the space above the tab to avoid it being pushed up when lifting the tool off the holder. The lock will click into place when put in.

### Disassembly notes
The lock can be pulled out by using the tab on the front of it. Then just slide the tabs up and take it out of the pegboard.


### Change Notes
Change notes will be updated as new features/changes are made.

The main difference is using the letters to **cut out from the lid** (instead of adding), so it can be printed without support.

changes:
- added 'text_elevation': Instead of adding the letters on top of the lid with main 'thickness', I created the extra hight for the letters. It can also be **negative**, what means: it's easy to print without support if turning around the lid. The former 'thickness' is now 'wall_thickness'.
- added ""letter spacing""
- the lid turns automatically 180º when 'text_elevation' is negative


I rendered 8 objects (2 version per each) but I printed only one (yes 'Zahnbürst' without ending e). 
the difference of the 2 versions are:
- one with negative letter offset - they are not easy to see in the previews since the lids are turned for printability: the top on bottom
- one with positive offset (just because it's visible here :)

1. It's about 6 mm taller than the actual AAA Battery.  Which causes the battery to rattle inside when closed. 
2. The little notch to keep the lid closed, Its a bit flimsy and the first time I slid the lid, it broke the base part.  The lid needs a ramp of some sort on either side of the notch so this does not happen.

A storage system for small parts, desined for 3D Printing and minimal material usage.
Customisable size and grid in a FreeCAD Project.

Github: https://github.com/DerRKDCB/Component_Tray_Stackable

This Tray is heavily inspired by https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3505602 from creator [chrismofer](https://www.thingiverse.com/chrismofer/designs)

Trays can be locked together with M2/2mm Cotter Pins [aliexpress](https://de.aliexpress.com/item/32972332173.html?spm=a2g0o.detail.1000060.2.161d6d90Fhh161&gps-id=pcDetailBottomMoreThisSeller&scm=1007.13339.169870.0&scm_id=1007.13339.169870.0&scm-url=1007.13339.169870.0&pvid=d631fafd-9563-479e-ad5f-fe660dfc227c&_t=gps-id:pcDetailBottomMoreThisSeller,scm-url:1007.13339.169870.0,pvid:d631fafd-9563-479e-ad5f-fe660dfc227c,tpp_buckets:668%230%23131923%2341_668%230%23131923%2341_668%23888%233325%2312_668%23888%233325%2312_668%232846%238112%231997_668%232717%237565%23716_668%231000022185%231000066059%230_668%233468%2315614%23530_668%232846%238112%231997_668%232717%237565%23716_668%233164%239976%23407_668%233468%2315614%23530)

## Variants

Default size is 160x160x15mm. Patterns in this size (up to 8x8 grid) can be found in the STL folder.
As the Tray is always square and symmetrical, for example 6x5 is the same as 5x6.

To change the size or grid pattern, you can just change the parameters in the Spreadsheet of the FreeCAD project, after that your custom tray will be generated.

With the Tray also comes an insert, which can be used to swap components fast.


## Printing

Recommendet settings:
- 0.4mm nozzle
- 0.2mm layer hight
- PLA

The tray is designed to use minimal filament and time, so the walls of the grid is only one parimeter. If you want to use a different nozzle you may have to adjust the parameters in FreeCAD.",,"['box', 'smd', 'smd_tray', 'storage', 'tray']",29,280,54,0,1,1,Tools,tool-holders-and-boxes,"It looks like you designed this from scratch in FreeCAD so it's all yours.

Pegboard system I designed and have been using for about a year now. I will admit I got some of the design ideas from Thingiverse and browsing the web, but the one thing that drove me crazy about the designs was how they worked with PLA and my printer.

Here are some things I tried to fix in my design process:

Simplicity in design.
Designed the pegs to not break easily and fit the holes without being to tight on the top row. This is where I saw most of my breakage.
Added extra supportive pegs to help support weight, align pegs better, and they are good to have with the support structure printing.
Added bottom level stepper pegs to some structures so they sit better on the pegboard and not slant.
Placed locking pegs on hooks and some other smaller designs so they do not pull out of the pegboard when removing tools.
Kept all the backs on hooks flat so they sit flush against pegboard and not wobble all over and with the locking pegs they are perfect.
I will continue to add more to this system and maybe upload more images and explain some of the design ideas more in-depth in the future.",,"['pegboard', 'pegboard_mount', 'peg_board', 'tweezer', 'tweezers', 'tweezers_holder']",1,143,48,0,0,0,Tools,tool-holders-and-boxes,

The reason for the joining is to combine the two elements that I like.  Namely the multi-level bottle holder which makes it easier to determine what colour you are grabbing and the paint brush/cups/pipette holder of the second file. The second file had a flat Testors bottle holder so I had to pull each bottle out to determine what was in there.  The multi-level was reduced from four levels to three but to accommodate the top section I had to widen it and it now holds seven bottles per row giving you 21 bottle capacity instead of the 20 with four levels.  I added a toothpick area in the enlarged pipette area.  

Recommend you grab these remixes as well. 
     This is the remix of a paint mixing station.  Original used the center area as a huge toothpick holder.  Enlarging it a bit made it more useful as a thinner bottle holder

This is a set of holders for the Motorola MTP850 mobile radio handset series
I created to easily store the radios in a vehicle or on a wall.

The holders themselve come in various remixes, either with a remote speaker/mic holder left or right or for the radio only.

For now I only included a wall mount and two mounts made for a 50mm square extruded aluminium profile, which are designed to fit the 2016 series GKW I of the german federal agency for technical relief.
They may fit to other trucks made by Rosenbauer, too.

If you need custom mounting plates, they are not that complicated to design, though...
Dimensions are included :)

The radio holders are designed to be screw mounted to the mounts,
but i chose to just use a strong glue...

Für Mitglieder des THW:
Die Halter wurden wie gesagt speziell für den GKW I mit Rosenbauer-Aufbau, Generation 2016 angepasst und sind für die Montage von bis zu 4 HRT850-FuG am Aluminium-Rahmen zwischen Front- und Rücksitzen gedacht.
Dazu werden jeweils 2 HRT850-Halter mit Mikro-Halter links und rechts sowie jeweils 2 kurze und zwei lange Montagewinkel für 50mm-Profile benötigt.
Die langen Montagewinkel werden unter der Fahrzeugdokumenten-Tasche verbaut,
die kurzen in der Nähe der vertikalen Profile.

Minor differences from arnoldcp's bin design:
- The walls are sloped, similar to the OEM HF walls. Note that this means the dimensions apply to the top of the bin.
- The bins are designed around the alignment screws; the corner rounding of the bin will be the same as the radius of the screw heads you choose as alignment pins (I used #4 sheet metal screws), and the screw should exactly align with the corner of the bin.

Unless the Thingiverse customizer starts working, you'll need OpenSCAD ( https://www.openscad.org/ ) and the excellent Belfry OpenScad Library, v2.0, ( https://github.com/revarbat/BOSL2 ). Both are free and open source.

Lesson learned - take time to read and understand what you are printing! I did not see that you had both a hex and a round version, and I printed the round version and had to make adaptations to use a hex nut / thumb screw.

What I did after printing is take a 5/16"" drill bit and drill down about an 1/8"" over the existing holes. This was perfect for press fitting in a standard (DIN 934) M4 nut and secured it with a bit of cyanoacrylate (super glue). It's holding up so far.

Now on to improvements I would make if I had to do it all over (maybe I'll remix it when I get some free time).

I would add hex shaped cutouts only on the inside of the body at the exit side of the round hole, since the nut will want to push up away from the lock cylinder when tightened I would have no concerns about the glue or press fitting failing. I have attached a quick mockup (see my Make pictures) just to give an idea what I am talking about...

The other thing I would think about - I originally printed this because when I put my euro cylinders in the vice it's always a little tricky to make sure that the cam can actually turn... what I like about this is the cutout ensures that it can... but the decahedron shape means that it can not be viced in a perfectly north/south alignment reliably, rather it has to sit at about a 18 degree angle. a 12 sided shape for the main body would allow for flat sides both north & south, east & west.After I'd designed my enclosures, this is what I wish I had done.. made one monolithic enclosure and then small inserts for each cylinder profile, much less filament used in the long run. I'm just not certain the ROI is there for me to start over and make it. Neat idea though, I'm interested to see how you expand on it"

(It takes a minute to open.)
Use the sliders and scroll boxes to change the settings.
Click ""Create Thing"" to create .STL file for your slicer.


If needed, you can use the work-around for the Thingiverse Customizer explained here by ""Way of Wood"":

See the Detailed Notes text file for more details.
Some example .STL file results are provided.

Up to 10 compartments (9 dividers) can be specified, in each direction.
Text labels can be added to the front side, for each compartment.

These trays can be made to fit the ParamBox, for instance by stacking two or more in a box. The top one may need to be made smaller to enable the lid to close. The ""front inset"" setting will help with this.

Slicer settings: No supports or raft should be required. Infill can be small, such as 10%. Speed can be quite fast, I printed these at 150 mm/s (first layer at 40 mm/s) using eSun PLA+ filament. You may want a slower print speed to improve the quality of printing.

I also removed the silly TS-100 text.

To make it you will need a 40cm long zipper preferably a coarse one (5-6mm track width). The rest is just stitching the zipper to the case. The case has holes and a groove for the thread to go in.

If you put in the zipper carefully you can easily take the two halves apart by fully opening it. 

I redid all the files with a newer version of Icesl so there are no resolution limits anymore on the stl files. I however still recommend plain 0.2mm resolution for the print.

However, if you've bought replacement tip sets for one, they could easily be lost or misplaced. Looking at the soldering station, it's got a pretty large flat area behind the controls that's perfect for putting something that could hold those tips. 

This print does just that by easily sliding over the back portion behind the controls you can easily store up to 6 tips and other small parts in the pocket. It doesn't obscure the vents and the tips are at an angle so you can see them a bit better while sitting down.

There is quite a bit of tolerance in the holes themselves, they do not hold the tips tight. In my experience, they do not fall out with most normal use, however, they may if the station is moved about. If this is an issue, the holes can easily be extruded all the way through, so that they won't move around as much.

The tips that I used are from TECKE, and were designed with that size in mind. Since the size is pretty standard, most ST series tips will work.

I recommend printing with the top on the build plate, that's how the one shown above was made, however, it may be possible to use supports.

After trying 2 of the existing cases for the TS-100 soldering iron I was a bit underwhelmed with how bulky they were and how fragile the hinges turned out to be. Also I did not manage to print one in PETG that would close and stay closed.

That is why I made my own as an exercise in learning IceSL. The curved edges make it feel a lot more handy than the other cases - also the zipper securely closes it without the fragility that small hinges have.

A downside however is that the stitching the zipper will take a while. The zipper I used was a 5mm zipper but a 3mm zipper should work just as well.

The STLs were rendered by IceSL so they are a bit ""weird"" and stepped in .2mm. This is also why the files are this large. If you look at them zoomed in you will see what I mean. 

You should print in .2 resolution as a minimum since a finer resolution won't get you anything.

A warning: Superglueing the zipper will turn the cloth parts hard and the glue will soak into the cloth thus affecting a large part of it. This will prevent the zipper from working well. You will either have to be extremely careful or stitch the zipper.

Also since this is the first time making a model in LUA with IceSL the code is a bit bad and I won't release it ;) ",,"['hardcase', 'icesl', 'ts100', 'zipper']",2,318,2559,1,0,1,Tools,tool-holders-and-boxes,"Yes, there are needle holes ;) - I see the STL previews didn't render so you can't see - maybe I will re-upload to fix that.

it can be a bit hard to sew since you need to shorten the zipper as well. I would suggest starting where the end of the zipper would be after shortening it. this is probably the hardest thing to figure out.How hard was sewing in the zipper ? Does the file have holes for the needle to go through or did you punch those afterwards(or just use an exceptionally thick needle for things like sewing canvas/tarp, etc. )?

It has a delicate coating which is easily damaged (which I did to mine). even if you can't get it out, use the filter cap ccd cover as it seals the CCD surface from the rest of the case. if you do mount the filter, clean the grove on the filter cap to hold it in place over the CCD. A space at the back is for a 40mm cooling fan. You could run a 12v fan off the 5v usb and it will provide some gently cooling. I didn't mount the fan yet so don't know if it will cause vibrations. Keep the screws from the quickcam and use them to assemble the case. happy star snapping.  

printing: use a dark/black plastic to reduce ambient light. at least 3 top/bottom. 20% infill.

Thanks for the design.

How can you do the focus without the lens ?
You need to use heat to remove the filter, most say use the barrel of a soldering iron. I've used a lighter, twice, to remove filters, the trick is not to let the filter sit in the flame but to hold the board vertical so the flame is just next to it after 15 - 20 seconds, the glue will melt and the filter will come loose.

Caution, the heat can melt the solder that holds the components on the board. do not let the flame get near anything but the glassThanks for the design!  I remixed it a little to use it for my Octoprint remote viewing.  Have had this webcam for almost 10 years, good to be finding a new use for it.

I found a razor to be a very good tool for removing the sticky prints from the bed. I couldn't find any suitable case, so I designed my own. It took me about 20 prototypes to create this one, that satisfies my requirements.

Model is easy to print, it takes about 45 minutes for 0.2mm layer height. The weight is about 5g and I had the best results with PETG filament and 60% infill.

I will appreciate the feedback, so feel free to share your experience in the comments.

As with many of my designs, tolerances are tight, PLA will not cut it for accuracy on this one.  
This design can and will show up any calibration issues with your machine, so please check carefully and methodically before complaining that this doesn't fit.  

You will need a couple of very short (5mm long X 3mm diameter) stainless screws. They should cut their own thread as they are screwed in (not too tight!)  

I gave this a very quick wash in acetone once the 3mm screws were set in place, and left to dry in a room temp area. This helped secure the bond between layers, and gave me a chance to correct alignment issues with the lid.

It bends to much, so I printed two small support blocks that are pressed between the Holdingarms and the base to prevent any kind of flex in the arms. If I had to print another one the arms would be connected to the bottomplate or Infill would be >35%.

This Stand is Inspired by the phone stand from GoAftens. It can hold different things. In my case it will be used to hold a 21"" PC Monitor that lost it's legs in a battle. The angle of the back-plate is 97° to the surface. It has a little cable holder at the back.

The Setting used is a speedy profile but it still needs over 1 day to print. For good stability it is printed sideways.

The supporttree had problems at the beginning (needs some tweaks), but managed to build up again. Some stringing and other stuff too, but all in all it seems to come out nice at the end.

First ... thank you for these great models. Love them!
May I ask you for a favor as I am a noob in 3D-modeling?
Would it be possible to make an L-shaped one?

Btw, by cutting the feet of I could get rid of the supports for the out ones. Height is still perfect and printing is easy as pie.The ""in"" variants print great,thanks. and make the containers much more suitable for tiny things. Did you ever print the ""out"" ones? The feet and make it unprintable with support and support at such low layers is a pain. Are they really required?I cut the feet of with my slicer (Prusa Slicer) and printed the 1x3 without any support just fine ... even the height is perfect without feet. Also the lid seals the cabinet as all the other (original) ones.Comment has been deletedThanks for your comment. I'm sorry in advance.

You are right. My mistake. The outer (""out"") parts should be print with support, but removing the supports after print from the final product is also a very tough job. I was printing every part from this set, and I recommend to use the ""in"" ones. 

I've printed couple dozen of the ""inner"" ones. The 4x1 are designed to be the best as easy to use as possible. After months of using them I recommend to use the 4x1 and 2x1 as well of ""inner"" boxes. Easy to handle, easy to put in, easy to take out. You can close the case and carry without one peace of 4x1 or 2x1 and rest of them stay in the position while you moving the case. Thats the biggest advantage. Perfect for organize and carry small, different parts.

I'll make some update in desc and photos.

First, I cut the inside pockets and the top half of the perimeter cut with a 1/4"" flat endmill.  

Then I drilled the mounting holes (centered in 4 of the collet holes) with a #30 drill. During the tool change, I screwed down the part with pan-head wood screws through the #30 holes I just drilled.  

Next I changed to an1/8"" roundover mill to smooth the edges.

The little hole was intended to put in a 6-32 heat-set insert for extra security, but I didn't end up needing them for the most part as friction was enough to hold everything in for me.

I printed the Versatrack rail mount parts with 8 perimeters which makes the Versatrack hanger part entirely solid.  I didn't have any issues with either PLA or PETG even for heavier tools like the jigsaw.  I had issues sometimes with them warping due them being relatively tall with a small base - using a 3mm brim seemed to help.

This design supports both magnetic hold-down as well as legs for use on non-ferrous surfaces.  The legs snap into the magnet holes so if you want to switch from magnetic to legs, you need to remove the magnets.  If you want to mount it on a wall, you'll need to drill some holes to screw the legs into the holder base, and to attach the legs to the wall.  3M Command strips might be strong enough to attach the legs to a vertical surface.

It's parameterized so that you can adjust the height, width, leg dimensions, etc. as desired.

This part is pretty long; it will fit diagonally on a Prusa MK3S but not on smaller print beds.  I printed mine at 100% infill to put more weight into it so it will stand up better with short legs.

I bought an inexpensive set of hex shank metric drill bits and metric taps.  Of course, the $10 tap set came carded under a plastic blister.

I saw some tap set boxes but not one for THIS tap set.  That may be true for you but the files include my Fusion 360 F3D file so you have a head start on a remix :)

The files include 3 knurled handles for the 3 smallest taps.  Expect to use a drill bit to ease out the bottom hole.

Print the top face down without support.  Having the text cut through the top was easier than cleaning up support.

The snap-on cover needs work.  Or maybe print it with TPU?  It's pretty tight and likely a nail buster to get it off.  If I finish a case for the hex bits, I'll see if I can learn how to make a hinged cover or something that at least comes off a bit easier and update this thing.

gracias..!Mine is now held together with a rubber band.  Tabs to secure the lid stresses the bonds between the layers in the wrong direction.  Printing on end isn't practical but would result in more flexible tabs.  A more flexible plastic would be good but I can't make my Ender 3 print TPU.

I used a yakAttack know and t-bolt that I had lying around, but any 1/4-20 t-bolt and 1inch knob will fit. There is a counter bored hole under the knob that you thread a M5x8mm panhead screw through, that sits in the track to keep the bracket from pivoting too much. I modeled the hole for the M5 at 4mm diameter, so you may have to drill it out or melt the screw in. But you want a tight fit. It probably wouldn't hurt to add a glob of super glue.

Yes the one in the pictures could be printed better. It's a PLA prototype to test the design, printed on a delta in dire need of calibration.",,"['geartrac', 'kayak', 'kayak_fishing', 'retractor']",3,498,68,0,0,0,Tools,tool-holders-and-boxes,

This should, when I print it, click in on the top rail like the V-Slot covers.  So the update here includes the v-slot as well as a labeled nozzle holder.  The clippers are in a handle holder and not just hanging like on other designs.  

You can also print the text and glue it in to the impression area.

Tool holder for:
5 allen wrenches
1 nozzle cleaner
1 small wrench
1 large wrench
1 screw driver
1 Creality white card reader
1 glue stick holder
1 spatula
1 handle end clipper holder

1 Nozzle holder bar with labels for .2, .3, .4, .5, .6, and .8 nozzles

In the pictures the light bar underneath the tool holder prevents my spatula from resting all the way down on the guard.  The allen wrenches are behind the spatula which is the reason for the second picture without it in the holder.

May 18, 2021 V2 update:  Version 2 does not use the V-Slot clip in top rail design.  You will need to take your rail apart to be able to slide this in.  I also moved the rail over a tag to give the spatula a bit more room.  On my setup this doesn't do any good because like I mentioned on someone's comment my spatula got caught on the light bar on the frame so even this move doesn't assist me but it might with others that have a wider frame.

I released a version 2 for the Ender 3.  THis does have the full channel insert not the simple clip on like the original.  I tested it out on mine and it works fine.  I did move the insert a tad over, not much, and it make the spatula about an extra mm further away from the bar.  As I noted before on my setup the LED holder that slide along the side of the bar prevents my spatula from sliding all the way down but I can certainly still feel it touching my LED holder.  In reverse order as is listed in the description this uses a handle holder just like the image shows.  It does not let the clippers hang.

As for the rails that hold it on I have had no issues with it.  For me it snaps on and off fairly easily.  

THe handle of the scraper does fit except on my rail it is stopped by the LEDs.  Given your issues which printer are you using?Two real issues with this tool holder...

1. The clip used to hold it on top of the machine is MUCH too fragile. You can't see it in the model photo, but it's a pair of very thin ridges. It broke when I tried to install it.

2. There is no place to hang the clippers on this tool. There is a very small hook on the back, but it's too small to hold the clippers.

Also, the area for the handle of the scraper is a bit too small, so the handle doesn't fit. Also it would be better if there was a way to print this flat instead of standing on end, as the holes end up full of supports that must be cleaned up."

Flipping just one link and the bending swaps to the opposite side at that point in the chain. The possibilities are really endless.  

One of the big drawbacks to the chain links is that in order to maintain the rigid structure the area where the cable reside must be closed. Not so, with this link, the cable cover piece  snaps into place allowing you to load the wire without have to disconnect anything.

To make the dripper:
* 1x 500mL water bottle with screw cap
* 1x straw, slightly taller than bottle
* 5cm air tubing
* silicone/waterproof glue

1. Cut two holes in lid -- one for straw and one for air tubing

3. Insert air tubing so 5mm inside inner lid
4. Glue tube holes to be leakproof, careful not to block inside tubes
5. Let set 24 hours
6. Tie air tubing into a simple knot
7. Fill bottle with water and screw on lid, then invert.

After you print the cap - it's best the stuff the battery into it while it's still warm to get a good fit. If it's cooled down use a heat gun to carefully warm the area - it doesn't take a lot of heat - and stuff the battery into the cap a few times - reheat the cap a few times if needed.

If the latch/clip arms don't align correctly with the base tabs you can soften the cap arms up a bit and twist them into place and toe them in for better contact with the base tabs. Don't overheat...

This system uses universal fasteners (bars), which are the same for any mounting unit. Only platforms that are mounted on trims differ. On one mounting unit, you need to print two bars.
This type of fastening provides greater reliability and durability of the node, and at the same time supports its dismountability without the use of bolts, nuts or any other fasteners.
In order for the mounting unit to be durable, printing must be done “sideways” so that the load in the model is not applied between the layers.
All models were printed on PETG plastic with very small allowances so that the nodes would be attached very tightly. If after printing the platforms do not “fit” into the trims, then adjust the allowances in the models or just slightly adjust the file or knife.

- width of case reduced 1.60mm (no more pressure to bed rail).
- width of bottom compartment reduced 11.60mm (more main board vent space).
- height of case reduced for bed roller mount bolt clearance.
- drawer pull handles redesigned and moved from center to right end (no supports needed)

It allows for water to move between the main reservoir that is used to wet the pads during sanding, into the cells that hold that pads to keep them wet during during use.

Update.

I recently updated the base of this design to version 4 which added a magnetic top to cover the micro mesh pads.  While I wasn't able to retrofit the magnet mounting system for the previous designs I didn't want people who printed the earlier versions to be left our.  I've added an STL file for the top that matches the V1 or 2 versions of the design.

The addition of the cover allows the pads to be protected from shop dust and include venting to allow some air moment as the pads dry.

This is PCB ready for production, just send it to JLCPCB or similar service. The other components can be found at Digikey. NOTE some components are surface mounted so this is not a project for beginners to start with.

---------

On top of our HAT we also had a display:

At some point your workplace may be cluttered with tools and other things you want to keep within reach. So did mine and i wasn't happy about the usual solution to keep adding one desktop organizer after another.

At this point this modular thing comes into play. It is designed to be expandable to your rising needs. Just print another module and slide it into the notch of the previous one....

As a bonus you can use the modules tilted if you use more than one row (as you can see in the photo above).

What to select?

If you simply don't care about perfect aestetics and want to stay flexible, just use the file ""middle-middle.stl"" and skip to the print settings section.

There are 3 groups of pre-made organizer modules. I have tested with 3 printers and 2 slicers and as far as i can judge from my tests - as long as you follow the print setting recommendations, all modules are interchangeable.

----

Another set of battery caps / holders. Although there are several examples of battery dispensers and holders out there, I decided to design my own - a very simple design. They simply stick on the batteries if printed with TPU or similar material 

The standard package size for batteries is four, but many devices need two, three, six or even only a single battery and to simply throw a replacement set into your bag when traveling I wanted a matching container to protect the batteries.

I decided to print little snap-on caps in TPU to keep a set and protect the terminals from unintended contact.

Batteries may slightly differ in diameter, the 10.5mm for AAA and 14.3mm for AA batteries seem to be a good compromise, at least it fits well on rechargable batteries from Panasonic (Eneloop), GP, VARTA and others (although GP seem to be a bit thicker than others). Play with minimal x/y scaling if the don't fit your batteries.

I've added STL files sized for the common Stanley brand screwdrivers; see pictures. The filenames for the Stanley base and carousel are appended with ""_Stanley"" at the end of the filename.

### Original Summary
A handy tool holder for your precision screwdriver set. The top rotates on the base so you can easily get to the tool you need.

You can customize it to fit your tools! The dimensions of the holes are fully adjustable and you can change the number of screwdrivers it holds, too.The included STL files fit the ""Reversible Watch Screwdriver Set"" from Esslinger, but you'll probably want to use the _Precision Screwdriver Carousel.f3d_ file and Fusion 360 to customize the part to fit your tools.

###To Customize this Thing:
1. Download the .f3d file and open it in Fusion 360
2. Change the parameters to fit your tools (see the image with named dimensions)
3. The hole for the blade part goes all the way through the carousel. Make sure the larger portion of the hole for the handle isn't so deep that the tool protrudes through the bottom of the base!
4. Change the _numTools_ parameter to set the number of tool holes
5. Done!

And with this enclosure sitting large and proud on my workbench I had all this space that I could do something useful with.

As I thought it might be a great opportunity to organise my tools that are strewn across my workbench I designed this Flexible Tool Rack. The idea is that you print as many of the mounting plates as you need and screw these onto whatever surface you have (I use 6G x 12mm screws). Then you print the required holders for your tools. The holders simply slide onto the mounting plates. Its a pretty snug fit but if your printer is dialled in OK things should fit nicely. If you put a bunch of the mounting plates besides each other you can create a pretty impressive tool rack

It's a work in progress but not to the point where this thing is unusable - I will be adding more tool holders and other bits I think of as I go. In the mean time I have also included a blank 3cm and 6cm holder which you can load into something like TinkerCad to create holders for your own specific tools.

If you make this thing or make your own tool holders then please create a Make or Remix link to my thing so others can find and download your designs as well :)

As I now have an enclosure around my printer I can finally print in ABS so that's what I used to print mine in 0.2mm layer height. Most parts print without supports; only the box you will need these to come out OK - I did use a brim for adhesion. The design should work OK in PLA or PET as well of course.

* A small 3d-printed ""spring"" in the exit opening hold the tape in place and prevents them accidentally falling out.
* The bump on the top is a catch for the film on the tape. Thread it through there and it'll stay out of your way as you use your parts. The top of it has a small opening, allowing you to easily slide the film in.
* The open side has a small lip to prevent the parts from falling out during handling.
* You can optionally attach multiple cassettes to each other using magnets. There's matching interlocks on the bottom to keep everything aligned.
* There are slots on the bottom that you can use to mount a cassette to a fixed surface using two M3 bolts.
* Designed to use a minimal amount of filament, only takes about 1 hour to print.

Altered and printed for my own Pegboard needs and sharing here in case anyone else can get use from it. Full credit to original creator as really all I did was add the mounting pegs.

<b>Print instructions:</b>

20% infill
4 wall line count. (Up from 2). This is important as it makes the pegs stronger without having to do 90-100% infill

To customize:

Open the .f3D file in Fusion 360.
There will be three components: Parts, Round Hook, Angle Hook
Ignore ""Parts"" (unless you know what you're doing)
Hide whichever you don't want to print, and show whichever one you do
Go to Modify in the menu, and then Change Parameters

The parameters you'll want to set are:
NumHolesHoriz (number of pegboard holes the box will span horizontally)
BoxZDistance - Depth of the box (how far it comes out from the pegboard)
BoxWallThickness
SlopeAngle - You can slope the top of the box down toward the front
BoxCornerRadius
ExtraBoxDepth
ExtraWidth
EdgeFilet (Increase this if it's too tight for the pegboard holes)

The front edges are notched to allow each tray to be pulled out easily. I have accounted for over-extrusion by leaving 0.25mm of space on all sides (0.5mm total on the width and the height).

Putting the bands with their sharp teeth in a drawer can easily become confusing. So I decided to hang mine over the room's door. These are 2630mm long and **up to 20mm wide**. I planned for two 4mm countersunk wood screws to hold this in place, but one per piece was plenty stable. Overall I put put too much thought into stability: this carries very little weight. I like to overbuild workshop equippment, though.

Of course, with a band saw, you can easily make holders from wood. I still preferred to print mine. These are **made from PET-G but PLA should word just as well**. I opted for .3mm layers which is not pretty but fast and stable. I also opted for a high temperature for reasons of stability. This needed to be printed diagonally on my printer bed (210mm edge length) to fit into my Anycubic i3 Mega,.

I did provide a commented OpenSCAD file which can be easily adapted for individual needs (wider or smaller blades, longer or shorter mounts, different screws...).

This allows you to print the model, pause the printer before the top is printed, add sand or other filler into the cavity, and then continue printing the top surface over the filled cavity.  This gives you a one piece item filled with sand or other filler that is ready to use when it comes off the bed.  You could use infill if you don't care to add a filler and print in one piece as usual.  See the notes below for more info.

Update 1/9/17:  I've printed later items with only 1 perimeter and they are more than strong enough for the purpose intended if they are filled with sand.  I used a 0.4 mm nozzle and 0.3 LH.  Any nozzle smaller than 0.4 mm might not yield thick enough walls to be serviceable with only one perimeter. 
- - - - - - - - - - - 

Note: These items were designed to be filled with sand to stabilize them because of their top-heavy load of files, screw drivers or hex bits.  They consist of a base and a hollow box shell.  Without a filler of some kind they may be useless for most things.  Also, since the box is just an open shell, it is not manifold, and may cause problems with some software.  It slices and prints OK using Slic3r and Repetier, regardless of the warning presented.

For the small box:
I started out to make a holder that was twice the size of this one, but I failed to notice that the holes were twice the size I intended.   Since my files did not have handles, it worked out well to just scale down the whole thing down to half size.    If you have files with handles, then maybe you can just scale it back up.  

After I printed my two copies, I made some minor changes to the Sketchup files to increase the thickness of the base and the height of the overlap between the base and box. I didn't print another after making these changes, so please let me know if you find a problem.  

For the larger box without a tray:  I found I also needed a place to put small Philips screwdrivers to get them off my bench, so this is a result of some editing and scaling.  The principal is the same; it's a hollow shell designed to be filled with something.  

NOTES ON FILLING THE CAVITY DURING PRINTING:
in order to add filler during the print, you have to modify the G-Code that is generated by the slicer.  The procedure here is for the code generated by Slic3r within Repetier Host for a RepRap G-Code printer.  It can probably be adapted to other slicers and printers, but Slic3r/Repetier Host is the only one I'm familiar with.  
If you are adding sand, wash it first to remove the fine dust that may stick to the last layer printed and reduce adhesion of the final layers that seal the cavity.  
3 top layers are probably best to insure that the cavity is well sealed.
Browse the sliced model layers using the Print Preview tab in Repetier Host and note the layer number where the first top surface layer is printed.  
Find the beginning of the first layer in the G-Code using the G-Code editor.  In Repetier Host editor, the color of the left border alternates color at each layer.
If your printer supports it, the M600 command will move the carriage to the side, pause and wait for you to push a button on the printer; add a line with M600  where you want to stop.  If that is not available, then the following patch should be added at the layer you want to pause.  Add the following two lines of G-Code before the top layer extrusion commands begin:
G1 X160
@pause (these commands may be different depending upon the flavor of G-Code used by your printer)
This will move the carriage 16 cm from the left side of the bed and pause the printer.
Add filler to the cavity.  
Drag the edge of a credit card or other object across the top of the filled model to remove any filler that might be higher than the top layer.  Make sure the top layer does not have any dust or filler sticking to it.  
Clean off any filament that may have oozed from the extruder and click on the CONTINUE PRINTING button showing on the slic3r screen.  
The top layers will print, sealing the filler within the cavity.  Make sure the filament temp is high enough that you get good adhesion; any layer cooling fan present can be turned off.  
You can find info on youtube showing this technique as applied to filament changes.  
In order to minimize wasted filament on your first trials, scale the model down in all axes and do a trial run; there are plenty of things that can go wrong .  Let me know in the comments if critical info is missing.

This was designed since CHMT Entry level P&P machines have very limited amount of reels (only 22x 8mm tapes with different values). 

1) Reels from the middle of the stack are complicated to replace on by project basis
this can be used to quickly mount the seldomly used components

2) Special purpose passives, big capacitors, and active components like LEDs, LDOs, TVS diodes,  etc can cost quite a lot for a whole reel.
This allows you to have a tape with only few hundred components instead of whole reel

3) There are 2 flat areas on Top and one on the back to use marker or label maker to note the Package, Value, Voltage, Tolerance, Model number, Cost of component...

4) Version 2 has a slot in the bottom(aprox 75mm or 3"" in lenght) to store the tape and some extra cover tape

To Do / Tips:
5) Use a narrow gift wrapping tape to extend the plastic peel to the winding wheel
6) A 12mm Aluminum tube on the wall can be used as storage rack
7) Use different colors for different component types (Capacitors Brown, Resistors Blue, ...)

The cover can be slid back and forth on the base parts attached to the glue gun body, so set the cover on the back side while the glue gun is in use and on the front side after use.

The base parts are attached to the upper side of the grip with strong double-sided tape such as 3M. (see gallery).
Attach the cover parts and rail parts together with adhesive.
Base and rail parts are symmetrical front to back.
It is recommended that the cover be lined with aluminum tape, as heat buildup may distort the cover if it is left heated for a long period of time. It will also make it easier to remove dripping glue when it sticks to the inside.

I recently got a Kobalt 40v battery-powered lawnmower and, of course, I got a spare battery for it.  Unfortunately, it's a big chungus of a battery and I need to stow it somewhere safe.

Enter this remix of dbarthel's battery adapter.  I scavenged the battery holder itself and made some heavy-handed modifications to suit it's new life as an inert socket to securely store the battery while mounted to the wall with 2 of my favorite flat-head drywall screws.

I have two editions of this:

**Mk. I** is the holder itself, just a plain box with rails.

**Mk II** is the same as Mk. I but with hexagonal cutouts on the sides in an effort to *slightly* shorten print time and material cost.  I will note, this is my first attempt at doing the hexagon cutouts thing so I'm sure it's not perfect.

For bostitch, the 18v tools that are compatible are sold at Walmart - I’m not sure if any of the 20v tools Lowe’s sells would be compatible (I think they just sell 20v nailers). I’ll do the same and test fit some the next time I’m at Lowe’s, and see if anything can be added to the compatibility list with minor changes.I tried the 20V craftsman and the 18v bostitch stuff. Honestly, I just took it to lowes and tried it on their models. It did fit my porter cable and black and decker stuff though

This stand is designed to be slightly larger than the body of the torch so you remove it from the stand when you pick it up.  That way the stand doesn't interfere with the use of the torch.  A permanently affixed stand would make it very hard to hold, since it is so short.

There are two versions uploaded.  The tall version (black) is quite a bit wider, allowing the torch to slip in easily but it is also taller to keep it upright better.  The shorter version (red) is tighter around the torch but about half as tall.  Personally, I like the shorter version better but I had the taller one done already so I thought I would include it if some folks wanted that instead. 

Enjoy!!

UPDATE 5/31/21: Added a small 5mm hole in the bottom of the short version to prevent a vacuum from picking up the stand with the torch if you happen to have overly shrinky material or you try and heat anneal the stand, like I did with a version I printed in PLA.  It shrunk just enough where it starts to get picked up with the torch.  My drill did the trick though.  :-)

UDPATE 6/1/21:  Added a version that is shorter and tighter that is designed to stay on the torch semi-permanently.  I printed with Reprapper PETG and it stayed in place perfectly with just a pressure fit, no adhesive required.  Your results may vary depending on printer and filament.'

UPDATE 7/3/21: Added Semi-Perm v2,  I noticed that the last version separated where cylinder met the base.  So I added a couple extra layers starting at the base that taper down as you approach the center.  All the dimension stayed the same so the torch still glides in and stays in pace with a pressure fit. As a result though, the walls are no longer match exactly the line width.  As such, you have to use the ""Fill Gaps Between Walls"" option in Cura (and I assume in other slicers) in order to make sure your walls don't have any gaps.

UPDATE 7/5/21: Replaced v2 with v2.1.  Something was defined incorrectly. Netfabb fixed it.  

UPDATE 8/1/21: Uploaded v2.2 of the Semi-perm version with a version that is wider at the intersection of the base and the ring.

Redesigned CC2224Max's holder as it didn't fit any of my T-shank blades.  Blades differ in thickness (1.2mm to 1.7mm) so these slots are 2mm wide.  Insert blades at an angle (10° to be precise) and then lower them to lock in the protrusion of the T-shank.  I thought about a sliding lock that acted on the top part of the T-shank but decided to keep it simple - it's an improvement you could make if you find they fall out.

I reduced the packing density of the blades so it's easier to get individual blades out.  The top clip can then store blades pointing the other direction to make up for that.  The offset of the top clip is because I have one blade that's 117mm long.  The offset gives space for that.

It's purpose is so that the user can easily bring their personal endmills to the cold metals work area to work on the bridgeport mill. It adds quite a bit of convenience, since you no longer have to keep to tools in separate containers. It's roughly the size of a pack of crayons.

The holder itself can fit up to 3"" long endmills. The purpose of the inserts is two-fold: 1) They position shorter endmills up higher, so they are equal length in the case, and 2) they stick out from the bottom, so if an endmill becomes wedged in the case, you can push it out. 

Versions:
- V1.1: Added support for 1/4 x 2"", 1/4 x 3"", 3/8 x 2"", 3/8 x 3"", and 1/2 x 2.5"" endmills
You just need to print the appropriate inserts for the various lengths. The most common sizes are still supported from V1.0.

- V1.0: Supports two 1/4"" x 2.5"" endmills, two 3/8"" x 2.5"" endmills, and a single 1/2"" x 3"" endmill.
You must print:
1x base
1x top
2x insert-0.25OD
2x insert-0.375OD
1x insert-0.5OD

The advantage of this  mounts is that you can take the charger away whenever you need it somewhere else. 

The mounting for the GAL 1880 is not as good as the others. it was the first one i made, because of that it's two parted. That makes it hard to assemble, also it was not that stable so the ""arms"" broke when we first put in the charger. Some small screws fixed that so I haven't had to reprint it. I applied some changes to my first design to make the weak parts stronger. I haven't tested those changes because i do not need another mount at the moment, but the changes should work well because the mounts for GAL 18V-40 and AL 1860 have the same improvements for the ""arms"" and there was no problem.

Probably not what you had in mind when you created this, however this worked perfectly for holding a dog fence in place.  

Very handy!What are the dimensions?  I am new here, sorry if it is posted somewhere.  Thanks.If you have a 3D printer or know someone who have one - just download the cable hook and start printing.
A printer cost and the plastic material and you are ready to go for all you can imagine of things to make. Personally I use the website Tinkercad to create my thing-designs - There are other software and websiites to do that but this is the one I prefer. When you have designed something then you can download the STL file which is the file to use on the printer.

Remember only the Printer itself is a bit expensive in purchase and this is a one time price. After that there is only a small cost for the plastic filament and then only your imagination sets the limit of your productivity.

The hook is strong enough to hold a power supply for a laptop. - I made the hook for a friend and he used it to hang up his power supply for his laptop.How do I get one of these sent to me?  I would like to try it out and if it fits my needs, request a bulk order.  Thank you.Hook Dimensions are:

486226,Pole Adapter for Expanding Foam Sealant Can,https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/ed/f4/6b/c3/bf/spraycan_display_large.jpg,2014-10-02,15,14,3,"Let me start off by stating, that I don't really expect anyone to make   
this thing.  I only made it to solve a problem very specific to my home.  
.  
I've got to say that this is what makes 3D printers so great.  I can  
make a custom tool which doesn't exist anywhere else (you can't   
buy one) to solve a problem; and it works!  
.  
I have a cape code style home with a metal roof.  While the metal   
roof is great and the snow slides right off it in the winter, it's a   
slippery surface that is dangerous to climb up on to do house   
maintenance even in nice weather.  
.  
Anyway, I needed to do some weather sealing around one of the   
dormers and didn't have any idea how I would get up there safely   
to seal the gaps.  I found a can of black expanding foam sealant   
that would blend in perfectly. (It's really for ponds, but should work   
fine on the house...)   
.  
While I was out looking at it, I thought it would be great if I could run   
it through a hose and fill the gaps, but I knew that was impractical   
because the hose length was too long.  I then thought it would be   
great if they had a pole adaper with a trigger I could use.  
.  
That's when it hit me that I could print one.  I have a pole for my   
roof rake that I used to use to pull snow off the roof (which I no   
longer need because I have a metal roof).  I used the existing   
spray can cap and the roof rake pole measurements and came   
up with this design.  
.  
I didn't need a fancy trigger because these cans work when you   
put sideways pressure against the nozzle.  Simply tying a string   
around the nozzle took care of the trigger for me.  
.  
Long story short (too late for that...)  It worked like a charm.  
.  
I'm always thrilled when I find a practical application for my 3D   
printer.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoy printing a Woolly Mammoth   
skull (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:480452 ) as much as the   
next guy, but it's not something that helps justify the cost of the   
printer and filament.  
.  
If you do make one, bear in mind that I haven't done any safety  
testing on it (what could go wrong swinging a pressurized can of   
flamable goop around on a pole above your head?),  that you should   
wear appropriate safety gear when using it, and that you use it at   
your own risk.",,"['custom_tool', 'expanding_foam', 'pole_adapter', 'sealant', 'spray_can']",1,429,1496,0,0,1,Tools,tool-holders-and-boxes,"Yes, and that last one always ends up cramping me and/or completely hindering me. :/I agree, you're really only limited by your imagination, your 3D modeling skills (and sometimes by the size of your printer...)

Set includes a Wowstick driver stand, a six-bit hex holder, a two-bit half-holder, and filler triangles that make cutting a base a bit easier (e.g., only external cuts required). Now we wish we'd done magnets from the beginning, but it's still likely we'll just keep whamming these onto MDF or aluminum bases for some heft. It's like tinker toys for 4mm bits.

The 4mm hex holes are fairly tight; printing on our MakerBot Method we get a good fit--you might need to tweak up or down a percent or two (or three?) depending on your printer's accuracy. We intentionally left the center of the hexagon empty so our fingers/thumbs have an easier time grabbing bits. We might tweak the hole chamfers (moar chamfoar) to make targeting bit return incrementally easier.

We may do a version with built-in holes for tiny magnets, but honestly, we'd rather just slab them onto something heavy with glue :shrug: We glued ours onto a piece of 0.5"" MDF for some weight: threw seven (center and one on each edge) on the MDF, marked the edges, and hacked off the corners with a miter saw.

We'll probably also do a similar 3d-printed base with a magnet on the bottom of each Hexa-Hex matched to magnets in the base: this will keep things (re)movable, and make that satisfying _snickety-snick_ magnet sound.

If you're wondering which screwdrivers we're using these for (affiliate links):

* [Wowstick 1F+ 64-in-1 Electric Screwdriver](https://amzn.to/3bc4zDK) (Rechargeable, pricey, nice to use)
* [General Tools 500 Precision Cordless Electric Screwdriver](https://amzn.to/35eeZib) (Two AA batteries, much cheaper--we got a small pile of these)
* [SainSmart Motion Control Screwdriver](https://amzn.to/396aiYW) (No longer available, AFAWCT)
* A couple others we can't find the links to now.

Nutshell is that we have a pile of 4mm bits along with the normal pile of .25"" bits.

However, as I was finally transitioning our current storage to these trays, I noticed a small issue: DDR4 SODIMM modules are 2 mm wider than DDR3 SODIMM modules, which is just _barely_ larger than what the trays support.  And so, with a wave of inspiration and an appreciation for the original design, I decided to make the required modifications to support the larger DDR4 modules.

To create this model, I pretty much reverse engineered the existing part, creating a brand new sketch in my CAD software using the existing dimensions, and then tweaking the dimensions.  What I aimed to provide with this new version were the following:
- Support for DDR4 SODIMM modules as well as prior generations
- Support for RAM modules with tall heatsyncs, especially RGB RAM
- More curvature around edges for a smoother look
- Higher walls for easier labeling",,"['computer_components', 'storage', 'storage_box']",3,714,158,0,2,3,Tools,tool-holders-and-boxes,"This is a great idea!  I've printed some other designs for HDD/SSD bays, but I haven't been able to find a design I particularly enjoyed.  I had the idea of making a stackable one, since that would greatly save space in my closet.

Alas, I don't feel comfortable sharing an editable version of this Thing.  As this is a reverse engineering of another Thing by @dambergn, I feel that it wouldn't be kind to distribute the raw CAD files without their permission.  However, I do love the idea of storage media trays, and plan to create variants for 2.5"", 3.5"", M.2 2280, and various MacBook SSDs!This is perfect, thank you very much!
Is there a way we can get an editable file for these, as I would love to use this concept for HDD 2.5 & 3.5 Storage as well

By the way my DDR4 sticks fit perfect.The DDR 4 still does not fit, there is a notch sticking out att the bottom of the channel that stops it from fitting all the way down, i printed the short one so I don't know if the bigger one has the same issue. Other than DDR 4 these are fantastic! Thanks :)I am glad to hear you were able to make use of it and good catch on the ddr4, I did not have any when I originally designed it so I had no idea that was an issue.Okay, so I figured out what's going on here.  Apparently I didn't upload the updated version -- oops!  I'm now uploading a new version which contains better measurements and an increased tooth + post height!So the DDR4 modules are 68.9mm and upper part of the slots are 71mm according to my calipers, maybe making the upper part a bit narrower would seep the DDR4 modules from being able to be crooked? Also adding 5mm to the height of the short version's posts would give it enough clearance when there are DDR4 modules be able to stack. Just my thoughts :)I agree, I found the extra 2mm quite frustrating.  I theorize it was to prevent people from trying to jam DDR4 modules into DDR3 slots or something like that, but if that were the case then I don't understand why they wouldn't do that for desktop modules as well.

Regarding the fit on this model, it definitely shouldn't be sitting crooked. I've long since left the job where I needed a design like this so I don't have access to a bunch of RAM modules any longer, but I'll see what I can do in the near future to fix this!On the ones I printed they sit crooked and protrude above the post on the short version. I hate that they changed the size of the SODIMM with DDR4, why not just move the slit like they have always done?The notch is by design!  I wanted a way for both sizes of SODIMM to fit snug in the tray, so my idea was to add a 1mm notch on both sides.  This would allow DDR3 and lower to fit snug all the way down to the bottom, while giving DDR4 a platform to rest on.  While DDR4 won’t go all the way down to the bottom, it should at least be sitting straight?I was pretty surprised to see the 2mm difference in laptop DDR4 modules myself, I'm guessing it's something to enforce not trying to use incompatible hardware.  :P

Thank you for your design, by the way!  We really love the stackability, and the clever positioning of the teeth to accommodate both laptop and desktop modules!"

I designed this around Sabre's 3-n-1 product: https://www.sabrered.com/pepper-spray/3-1-compact-pepper-spray-clip .  I chose it because it was small, cheap, well reviewed, & had two types of irritants.  The holster is designed for a 1.5"" belt, but could probably be worn on a 1.25"" just as well.  On my belt, it sits rock solid and does not move.  The bottom of the holster is open so that you can just slide your little finger through the slot and the canister pops out the other end in your hand at the ready position.  Very quick to deploy.  To make the thing a little more discreet, I attempted to color the red button and the silver bottom with Sharpie ink.  It does not work well over time, and I will have to get some black paint eventually.  My original designs were bigger and more rugged, but I thinned it out as much as I dare to make it smaller.  I have been using it for about a month now and no damage.  I may vapor smooth it to make it that much stronger, but I haven't gotten a round 'tuit yet.

I love this design because the supports are incorporated into the model, not inserted by the slicer. The advantage of this method is that it is way more consistent among printers and slicer supports tend to be messy.

First off I had to fix the original STL, as it had a lot of errors and wouldn't render correctly until I fixed them. I've included the ""fixed STL for the original in the Zip file. 

Using openSCAD, I imported the STL and filled in the holes. Then I created three 1/2"" by 1/16"" (approx) internal holes for the magnets.

To embed the magnets you need to insert an M601 (pause) command into your gcode at the first layer that covers the holes. When the 3D printer stops, insert the magnets into the holes and continue printing. I'm not going to go into detail because there are many tutorials online that show how to do this.

1) Snap the hinges into the box bottom's hinge hoop making sure that the hinge tabs are fully engaged and locked in place.
2) Flip the hinge tabs to the up position and place the box lid over the box bottom with the hinge hoops over the hinge tabs, press the box halves together until the hinge tabs fully snap into the hinge hoops and lock in place.
3) Push the tab of the latch through the latch hoop on the box lid until the latch tab fully locks in place.

So it turns out Ponoko does have different requirements (0.01 mm diameter lines for cutting, plus they have to be blue). If you submit v2 to them, please let me know if it works! Thanks for your comment -- gave me the chance to re-open the file and fix the alignment challenge I was having. :)
Hi there! Interesting -- the file worked as-is using the machine I had access to, but I've never tried Ponoko. I'm actually hoping to edit a few of the hole locations -- maybe I could set everything to the Ponoko specs while I'm at it. Let me get back to you if I succeed!
I'm going to preface this by saying I know zip about laser cutting. However, I tried to upload this to Ponoko to have it made, and it wouldn't take the SVG file. This is the error I got:
""the line colors in your .svg file aren’t quite right. You need to use the right colors for cutting lines and/or vector engraving lines so we know exactly what you want us to do. It looks like you've used a raster engraving color on a stroke. It’s easy to fix. Select the objects with black or gray stroke color and expand these to fills.""
Is this just Ponoko? If so, can you recommend another website to go to?
Thanks!
Holy frijoles! That's awesome! If you want a PSD of the logo itself to throw on the top, I'd be happy to get that to you. Also (and this is a little thing, but...) It's LibraryBox, all one word. That will help with the finding. :-)

It keeps the pump upright, and the inlet as close to the bottom of the tank as possible, whilst leaving a small amount of water below it in attempt to leave any sediment behind.

This is part of a project to build a rainwater toilet, but may find uses elsewhere that these little pumps are used. The liquid sensor allows for the power to be switched off when there's no water available to pump.

The ""water-pump-float-holder"" variant is the same design, but with space to hold a Gentech LCS-01 horizontally mounted float switch.","Printing: I used 0.2mm layers, 50mm/s print speed with 30% infill. Less infill is possible, although makes for a slightly bendable holder.

Once printed, there's a block with a 2mm hole for attaching one end of a liquid sensor (via a 3mm self-tapping screw). The liquid sensor I used was an Assemtech WS1. On the other side there's a hole for another screw to act as a grub screw to hold the pump in the holder. The power cable for the pump and the signal cable for the sensor can be cable-tied to the hose that will be attached to the pump.

Once assembled, the pump and sensor can be immersed in the water tank, and should maintain an optimum position to pump water upwards, hopefully without disturbing, or indeed sucking up too much sediment (if any builds up at the bottom of the tank).

If you find liquid sensors are unreliable in this environment (which mine proved to be very quickly), then use the ""water-pump-float-holder"" variant which will accommodate a horizontally mounted Gentech LCS-01 float switch.

This part was created as part of a project to fil our toilet with rainwater (and save up to 24% of our water bill). This part goes inside a water butt that collects and stores rainwater. The pump will push water up to a tank in our loft, which feeds water to the cistern on the toilet.

It's best to wash the dust out of the sand.Thanks for the design; my x-acto knife was calling for something like that.  Ditto for the .SCAD file.  I customized one to fit my knife, increased the base thickness and filled the base with sand during the print.  Now I know where to find it when there's a need.Cool.

update:
this didn't hold on well enough not to move. I found it was rotating out of the way, sliding down, and not working very well. The engine does shake a bit when it's running, so I shouldn't be too surprised. To fix this, I added a small pocket in the previous model to rest on a peg, then I drilled and tapped an M4 hole in the metal tube of the pressure washer, and put a screw in it.

A tray I made to hold loose screws and parts during tinkering. Easy enough to write down ""A - Screws inner controller ribbon"" and ""B - Screws outer shell"" in a notebook or post-it nearby. The table I have it placed on is metal so the magnets hold the gadget a bit firmer in place, as well as holding the screws in place inside.

You have 9 bowls where 8 of them are labeled. If you are working on bigger projects with more loose parts you can use it as 4 big bowls instead. The middle bowl is intended as a ""this is the screw i'm using right now""-temporary holding place. There's a slight lip on the rim of the bowls so screws/washers/nuts are easier to pick up.

I recommend printing it white since the details get hidden when it's black, especially the lettering. I printed this with 0.2 but it's a bit rough in the bottom of the 'bowls', so I can suggest trying 0.16 or 0.12 if you want it smoother, but I have not tested it.

What helps hold the tool in the holster? Gravity, Friction, or is there a lip that it actually snaps into?Hello,
I made the closed version this using the standard easy settings on Creality Slicer and my ender 5 plus using extremely rigid PLA Carbon Fibre bought at amazon: https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B07GNBVTD9/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
I really liked the look of how it turned out and how it held the multitool, put it on my belt and when i bent over to put my shoes on the first time the belt loop part snapped completely off. I have other regular PLA filaments and i have a few PETG filaments as well, which one should i try to use so this doesnt happen again and what settings should i put on the Creality Slicer program? Infill etc, im very new to this so i dont know what my settings should be to get the most out of this build. any advice people can give me would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks
Just friction. I designed it exactly to fit the dimensions of the tool. If it is too tight, you may want to reduce your flow/extrusion multiplier slightly... maybe 2-3%. You should use PETG for this. You don't want a really rigid filament or else it'll snap! This is a very snug fit on the multi-tool. 

I printed my latest iteration at 250C at the nozzle and 80C on the bed for PETG. The higher temp allows for better layer adhesion. Use almost no fan to ensure the PETG doesn't shrink. Infill should be 20% or higher. 3 perimeters. No supports required. Use a brim, though, as that first layer doesn't have much to keep itself stuck to the bed. "

The new, 2017 model only has 10 slots in the top 3 rows, and 6 in the bottom, all together 7 slots less. The top 3 rows are closer to each other, so the dividers are smaller.

* The parts should snap together easily when you stack them. If not, you may need to glue them together.

These cartridge boxes are printed as separate parts that are printed in orientations chosen to maximize strength and then snapped together.

The box halves require moderate infill (10%-20%) and can be printed with no supports, but I prefer to paint on supports under the flat sections on the hinge hoops, the latch brackets, and the latch catch. I printed with 0.16 layer height in PETG and PLA.

Like some of you out there, I don't have a ton of tools that vary in my day-to-day in the 3d printing space, but I do need some storage.  I printed a few Milwaukee Packout Bins from this site and really like them.  I would just like a way to store a few of them without having to invest in an entire Milwaukee Packout system.

I initially started this as a small bracket to hold the bin and have it mounted under a desk, shelf, or work surface, hence the 2 holes on the top.  I left them so that can still be done.

From there I moved to stackable as I don't have many ideal places for these to be mounted (semi)permanently.  I tried having a unique, slot system on the top and bottom to have the bins fit into each other but I worried about them when you just have one holder.

The final draft is attached to this thing listing.  I went with magnets on both the top and bottom to be super-glued in place.  Max of 8 magnets may be overkill for some but just right for others.  You don't have to use all, I would just match the placement with other holders if you intend to stack them.  Also, be sure to double-check your magnet poles before gluing!!! 10mm x 3mm magnets

Windows on the sides and oddly placed slot indentations are just to cut down material.

There is also a version for the double-wide Packout.  to be slid in sideways.  I just plane cut the original and lengthened the middle section.  M4 mounting holes turned into mounting slots.

Planning on testing this model at a .3mm layer height and 30% infill to start. 4 Walls
I use Overture filament on an Elegoo Neptune 3

I plan on adding this to my own Etsy shop.  Others may sell this if desired.

UPDATE 12.25.22
Stacking these I noticed that the cut out at the top, which was designed to pull the bin out with easier, is blocked by the base of the above holder.  

I've added a cutout to the base of each size to fix that.  I've altered the title of the previous file to include ""BASE"" in case users want to have a dedicated 'bottom' holder when stacking these.",,"['container', 'magnets', 'milwaukee', 'milwaukee_packout', 'packout', 'stackable', 'stackable_container', 'tools']",4,115,474,0,0,1,Tools,tool-holders-and-boxes,"100%!

When I initially started this design, I didn't have them stackable and the bottom wasn't actually there.  My intention starting out was to hang them underneath some shelves in my office.  That seemed a little limiting if I wanted to move them around the house.  So I added the bottom and just sort of ignored the mounting holes when the magnets came into play!

But it's a good call out and I'll be sure to add these!  Thanks for the feedback.  It really helps as I get more hours into my design practice.I would say that you may want to consider having holes at the bottom to allow a screwdriver or nut driver to screw in to the holes you have at the top."

Thanks for your work.No problem. I love designing things but like it more when I'm working with someone else. If you hadn't guided me then I wouldn't have corrected this and that is well worth my time in my opinion.

Aside from projects here and there I am quite bored, so if you have any ideas for things to be created feel free to hit me up.I'm sorry the update that you made to account for the label actually works for me so fo the cartridges thank you for working with me on itCan you confirm the vial dimensions? I only use the Humalog 10ml (1000u) vials so I am unable to measure the vial in question.

If you could just get me the diameter of the widest portion of the glass and a photo of the side profile (Google search is fine) I can probably sketch something up.

Alternatively if you could give me the details on the medication such as ""Humalog 10ml vial"" in my case I may be able to fine enough detail online to create an alternate version of this. I'm going to search in general but I can't picture what you are talking about without seeing it (preferably in hand). If you have an empty vial and are willing to ship it to Portland Or, I would be happy to digitize it and update this image with it's dimensions.

Let me know what you've got and I'll see what I can do. Also let me know if you have any other feedback.The notches seem to work I used a better filament this time but the vial holder is too small but its because we have 300ml Vials I made this and printed it in the highest resolution the notches seem to mess up the cartridge a little and the insulin vial I have doesn't fit  how can I fix thisJust printed the 15mm and the vial and cart slid in without any resistance. The only cleanup I did was removing the brim.

Let me know if you still experience issues.My apologies. Thank you for letting me know. I have a little wiggle room around the cartridge slots and I fixed an issue a while back with the cartridge layout. I updated the files on here just in case I didn't before or if there was an issue. Can you describe the issue with the cart notches? Are they two big or misaligned?

I did increase the diameter on the vials from 23mm to 23.5 to account for label (I use Humalog if the issue is a different vial size and had measured the glass, not including the label).

I printed the new one in the 15mm but forgot to update the vials before doing so, I'm printing once again to verify sizing but it should be better now. Let me know if you print again and if there are any further issues or not. 

Always open to feedback as well (bigger, smaller, more or less of either vials or carts, slots for other things, etc.)

Now I have a few other items on here to update ;p (the vial template and the cartridge template)"

<h2>Version History</h2>

<h3>Version 1 - Soldering Iron Holder.stl</h3>

This version uses a pair of 10 x 3.5 x 2.25 mm N45 Neodymium magnets in the base of the print to attach it to a suitable surface. I used a tiny bit of superglue to keep the magnets in.

<h3>Version 2 - Soldering Iron Holder captive magnets.stl</h3>

This version also uses a pair of the same 10 x 3.5 x 2.25 mm N45 Neodymium magnets in the base of the print, this time however they are completely encapsulated by the print, so you will have to pause the print at a layer height of 3.5 mm and install the magnets, then resume the print. The result is that the holder still works well, but it is not held to the surface quite as strongly as the version where the magnets protrude from the back of the print.",,"['magnetic', 'magnetic_holder', 'soldering', 'soldering_iron', 'soldering_stand', 'ts80', 'ts80_soldering_iron']",2,263,481,3,0,1,Tools,tool-holders-and-boxes,"I got mine from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Magnet-Expert-2-25mm-thick-Neodymium/dp/B003FBRFVS/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1551097856&sr=8-2&keywords=10+x+3.5+magnet).

I used 123D Design and Tinkercad to complete the design. 

There are two Zip files that contain the appropriate STL files – one for a large strongbox that is 280 mm long and one for a small one that is 160 mm long.  The files are also listed individually.  The large strongbox size (280 mm) was selected to fit within the limits of an FLSUN i3 (300x300x420) printer.  I scaled down the large strongbox using Tinkercad to produce the small (160 mm) strongbox design for printing on smaller build volume printers.  I have only printed the large strongbox, but the small one should print just as well.  

I included a design for a small wrench to tighten and loosen the bolts.  If you use the wrench, make sure you avoid over tightening and twisting off the bolt heads.  The bolt heads are roughly 20 mm across the flats - the wrench is about 22 mm to provide a loose fit.  The wrench was designed using Tinkercad. 

The bolts and nuts used in this project were designed using NUT JOB – Nut, Bolt, Washer and Threaded Rod Factory by mike_mattala (www.thingiverse.com/thing:193647).  An exploded view assembly drawing is provided to show how the parts fit together.  Each strongbox requires a total of 27 bolts:

      20 – 17x11mm bolts for the top, bottom, ends, and front corners
      6 – 20x11mm bolts for the back hinges
      1 – 25x11mm bolt for the front hasp

The bolts, hinges, connectors, and end pieces are the same size for both the large and small strongbox designs.   All hinges should be printed with the narrow edge against the build plate and using a 3 mm brim.  I found this worked better when cutting away support material to enable the hinges to rotate.  Be careful when cleaning up the hinges to avoid breakage.

Note about printing the pins: You need three.  These are small parts.  If you print one at a time, they are nice an clean.

This time including template models so you can make your own pegboard things, along with a sample of what you can make with them.

This used my new and improved two piece mechanism that allows the parts to be printed flat and friction-fit together, and doesn't require any supports! This results in less weak points, less part breakage, and less print failures. 

The 'anchor' piece inserts into the pegboard, pushing the 'attachment' piece firmly against the pegboard and keeping it in place. Use needle nose pliers (or similar) to firmly push the two pieces together prior to inserting into pegboard.

To remix, use the anchor piece as is. Modify one of the attachment pieces so that it still fits into the anchor. I have provided sketchup and stl files for you to play with.

To get rid of my drawer cabinets I designed this thing to put all kinds of screws and stuff in a single drawer of a workshop bench.

I wanted to use existing separators in the drawer, so I designed the boxes with slots on each side in OpenSCAD. The system can be adapted for many sizes – different box widths, lengths/slots and heights. I use mostly half height und quarter height boxes with different numbers of compartments.

To construct those I used a stacking algorithm that stacks centered rectangles onto another and create a single polygon out of it. This is passed to the wonderful round-anything lib from IrevDev to create the extruded 3D object with inner and outer roundings. This would have been impossible to do with OpenSCADs Minkowski method, because it does not round the inner, concave edges.

Use OpenSCAD to change all settings and remix your own boxes.

1) Insert the middle of the cable in the shaft on the ""inner"" part
2) Place the ""outer"" part over the shaft
3) Secure using the ""clip"" part. Hold the shaft firmly rather then just pushing in since the stress on the part can break it at the layer lines. You may want to remove any elephant foots from the clip to allow it to slide in smoothly.
4) Wind the ""inner"" part to retract the cable.
5) Pull the cable to extend it

5151314,Modular Paint Rack for Tamiya model paints,https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/bb/44/98/da/ef/large_display_2021-11-30_11-47-28.jpg,2021-12-01,13,19,0,"<H1>Modular Paint Rack for Tamiya Model Paints</H1>
I couldn't find a rack I liked for Tamiya's 1oz (30ml) and .33oz (10ml) paint jars so I created this one. 

This stacking system allows you to house as many paint jars as you want on your desk in tiers of 3 as well as a general purpose bin sized well for your Tamiya cement bottles, micro set and other odd sized items. 

The .33oz rack holds 5 jars and the 1oz rack holds 4 jars.

Each rack has a tongue and groove fitting on the left and right to tie them snugly together and a tongue and groove to let them join into tiers vertically. Each vertical tier will need the legs printed. I can create a 4th row set of legs if someone wants them. 

This is my third prototype version after some experiments with how to link and stack them. Any and all feedback is greatly appreciated. The photos are actually of the Mk II version. The only difference is I refined the stacking slots to be a better fit and hold and went up to 4 legs under each tier instead of 2 to eliminate the possibility of lean and need for the tier stacking height and legs to be exact. 

Legs will need to be attached with super glue. You may wish to join the tiers with super glue as well if you have a permanent setup.

 - A paint brush and small parts rack thank links into the system
 - Racks for Model master Jars. (let me know if there's an interest in other brand bottles)

- added 2 pairs of magnets at the latch
- deepened the top recess to fit standard length bits (25mm)

While I haven't finished a complete print and built the new version yet (finished the bottom, but the top failed with 15 minutes left go figure, entirely due to my printer), I can 100% confirm the bits fit in the new design.
As a fun plus, the new bit depth is incredibly satisfying with the LTT bits, as the base of the bit sits flush with the case now, which just looks fantastic!

I appreciate the help and tweaking to the case! I'll try to sand it down after and post a make/picture once I get it done.Added a v2:
- added 2 pairs of magnets at the latch
- deepened the top recess to fit standard length bits (25mm)
But i didn't deepen the holes for the latch magnets because they should fit the magnets perfectly as they are now. I did test this again by glueing them into place carefully with thin superglue. If you use any other ""thicker"" type of glue, just drill them a bit deeper.

Other than that, I hope your bits fit :)For the LTT bits they're fine; apologies if I didn't make that clear. Actually the whole thing is pretty amazingly well made.

Currently LTT is out of stock for the torx bits (because of course that's the only one out of stock lol), so for the time being I've been using https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09TSRHP4M for my torx until they're in stock. These are also the same base height, but the shaft of the bit is a tad taller. It just means that maybe not all low-height bits can be used, but LTT's does work just fine.

That said if you ever do make a v2, slightly more shallow magnet holes for the clasp might be nice. That or maybe go from 4 to either 6 or 8 magnets to hold it closed, because it feels like it can open a bit easily. Though again, minor issues; absolutely loving how the case turned out!Hello, thanks for your comment!

How much more height do you need to fit your bits?

For me the 4 magnets are flush. I glued them in place with superglue. Did you use hot glue which adds some height itself? You could of course just drill the holes half a mm deeper. Or i could design them maybe 0.3mm deeper? But as I mentioned before, for me they are flush. So maybe its your glue or installation method?

Please let me know! I will definetly add a V2 for longer bits.Fantastic case!
It fits the hinges good and tight so they don't need glued, fits the screwdriver well, and fits the LTT bits perfectly including with the magnets in place.

Only things I wish were different, if anything, is I couldn't put any bits slightly longer than the LTT ones in place, and the four magnets which latch it closed aren't flush. But the latter could also be fixed if just installed with care, maybe inserting them with a flat surface so they stop at the surface of the case.

But again, minor stuff. Love the case and just wanted to give my feedback in case it was of any help.
Easily the best LTT screwdriver case on the site as far as I've seen!"

I really like the Xiaomi micro bit set, it have an aluminium enclosure that holds the bits safe and the bits also rattle less compared to other bit sets.
But it has too few slots to cover all the bits I want, so I made a design with a lower second layer for an additional 24 bits.
Each row can be populated with a bit holder out of a softer material like TPU or NinjaFlex to make the bits rattle less in the case. Each bit holder have a slot for a magnetic strip inside.
A shorter bit holder is also available for bigger micro bits like hex socket.

Instructions:
1.) Slice the bit case, I used PLA with a brim and no supports with good results.
2.) Choose the type of bit holders you want, I choose TPU which created some small threads.
3.) Open up the original Xiaomi caste and remove the magnets, push tom in to the slots in the bit holders.
4.) Gentle squeeze in the bit holders in the bit case.
5.) Optionally you can make some labels for corresponding bits. I Cut out 0.6mm brass plate and laser engraved the labels.

Wanted to add the Dungeons and dragon 5th edition logo to the top as I thought it would look amazing. I was able to use meshmixer (and some other tools) to convert the logo to a STL, fix it in meshmixer, and apply it to the lid. 

This has a large side effect as you now have to print the lid upside down from normal. Due to the beveled and raised nature of the lid, this required a lot of support to print properly. I use cura and the settings I choose were:

Generate supports
Placement: Everywhere
Pattern: Zig Zag
Density: 15%
Support Z distance: .4mm
(I left the rest of the support values auto calculated)

I did have to print with a raft because I got horrible curling at the edges with such a minimal amount of the model touching the build print when printing this way.

The inside finish suffered with these settings but given it is the top of the box, I was willing to make the tradeoff to add the logo without the need for glue. I had planned to use the switch at layer plugin to print the dragon in red but when I copied the file over to print, I sent the version without the Z plugin gcode. Still looks amazing!

It is great to know that the design is being used elsewhere.This works great!  My collections of 30 tips went from sitting in a cup to this.  Big improvement.  Thank you!Hi, Assafl!

Thanks so much for making this! I just got my first Metcal and have been looking for a way to hold all the tips. When I printed the model as you have uploaded it, I found that the tips were too loose for my tastes. So, I experimented a bit with the dimensions of the holes and came up with this model. Granted, I am using the new CV tips, but the CV station is backwards compatible with the MX series tips. I thought I would upload my OpenSCAD file in case anyone else could make use of it.Oh, that makes sense. Thanks again for doing this! It really gave me a great place to store them! I have just been placing the hot tips off to the side until they are cool enough to put back in the holder. I agree that the mat makes it hard to put them back in the holder while hot. I gave up on that idea. :)Awesome. 

The intent of the design was for the tips to be both loose and upright - so the they can be ""dropped in"" while hot and held with the rubber mat. The mat made it relatively cumbersome to stick them in a tighter fitting hole. 
 
Hence the tapering in the base (and the rather gratuitous depth).  


Thanks for sharing.

With these models you can print for the front all the normal pieces, until you hit the end where you need either the ""1+20mmx4"" or the ""113mmx4"",

As you cant pull the drawers out really far, i made a few backparts that are all 229mm long,
so for all the longer stuff you have to put in there.
So everything with a ""229mm"" in the name is for the back.
The ""1x229mm"" or ""2x229mm"" to fill the back up, and the ""1+20mmx229mm"" or ""2+20mmx229mm"" as the end.

I'm in the middle of another project right now, but I might consider redesigning it as a 'last row' solution and incorporating the last row leg into the body of the tray, which would allow inclusion of support for those big cutters into the body.

15% infill is what I have been using, you could probably get away with 10%. A layer height of .2 works well.

Printed from black PLA, and labels are hand painted. They're attached with #4 3/4"" wood screws. Also included are DXF templates for mounting. I used 1/2"" plywood and laser cut the mounting holes. I've shared a Fusion360 archive to make it easier to modify these. If exporting STLs from Fusion360, make sure to do so before the step in the timeline where they're aligned to the mounting board--for best printing results, the holder must sit at an angle on the print bed so that the label is flat.",,[],59,918,42,0,0,0,Tools,tool-holders-and-boxes,

It simply sits on the inside rod but spins very smoothly.
I have put a plastic box which is rather light on one corner so I can pull wire while holding smartphone in left hand to be able to film: https://youtu.be/RlavGU9DoWI 

I have decided to simply make a little tighter hole on top and use a bolt which usually goes with a threaded nut.
This way during first in-screw of the  bolt it makes the thread. And it is easy to do because the thread is rather fine.
And to ensure the strength I use a longer bolt. But sure It is possible to go with a threaded insert.
Looks very nice. How smooth does the spool spins? Does it sit on some bearing?

Also, you may want to use McMaster 94180A333 for the thread at the top. You push that threaded M3 insert in with a small solder iron tip and once it cools it's rock solid."

In a tough and difficult period like this, each of us tries to protect and protect loved ones to the best of their ability against the current threat of the Covid-19 virus, also known by the name of Coronavirus.

An important natural resource that can meet us and help us in this important battle is ozone (O3), a powerful oxidant that destroys bacteria and also a high percentage of viruses.

During this period many people have bought or are about to buy special ceramic generators that produce ozone thanks to the corona discharge effect obtained by bringing the poles of a high voltage transformer connected to special conductive plates covered with ceramic. I myself purchased two of these devices, but which due to the high voltage circulating in the appliance are not ready to be used out of the box, as it would risk taking the shock by touching one of its components loaded at more than 30,000 volts .

Hence the need to insert these generators in a box that acts as a protective insulator for our safety, and makes its portability much more practical. As a design engineer, I didn't have the time and desire to draw something that could solve the problem, but I rather thought that I would find something practical and aesthetically pleasing here on Thingiverse that was ready to be printed and assembled.

But I didn't find anything that really satisfied me, so I designed it and made it available to anyone who wanted to use it in turn.

Two only clarifications:

1) the original design provides a thickness of 4mm of its main walls, due to the high electrical insulation required. Since it takes 24 hours and about 600 grams of good PLA to print this original project, I thought I would also publish a lighter 3mm version (thin) so that I could print it faster, but I do not take any responsibility in In case neither of the two versions proposed is sufficient to adequately isolate and secure the generator, I printed it with top quality and well preserved material and everything works without problems.

2) compared to the photos, I rotated the handle 90 ° to facilitate assembly once the generator is inserted in the box. I have foreseen the use of 4MA stainless steel screws to avoid their oxidation, and the gluing with hot glue for the feet produced in TPU 85 ShoreA. 
The main box has been deliberately designed all in one piece for reasons of robustness and compactness, this could make it slightly more difficult to insert the generator inside it, but it can be done without problems.


LAST THING: DON'T JOKE WITH OZONE. This gas can be very useful in the disinfection of our environments but it is also very dangerous if inhaled directly for long periods of time, as it would inexorably oxidize our respiratory system.

I advise you not to stay in the environment you are dealing with ozone, and to ventilate the rooms well after the treatment and before staying there.

I wish you all the best possible for you and your families, that you can overcome this bad moment without consequences and that we can all embrace each other as soon as possible.

With the top in place you can simply put the cover back on and dump the water out without worrying about your pads falling out of their spots. I also added a cover for the bowl section that allows you to cover that section as needed to avoid anything getting into the water when you're not actively wet sanding.

I'd strongly recommend printing the sunglasses clip and top phone piece perpendicular to the print bed for greatest strength. I also included some ""washers"" for these pieces to help spread out the load of the fastener and help avoid splitting those pieces.

The best way I could come up with to hold the springs under tension while assembling was to grip each end with a pin vise, though even this took a little finesse (see picture).

A two-part elastic edge protector for bench chisels. Keep your chisels safe, even when on the move!

### Assembly & Usage

Once linked by two pieces of elastic, the covers can clip over the edge and handle of the chisel keeping the edge safe. The edge cover has an internal taper set to 25 degrees with the intent of matching the primary bevel of the majority of chisels. The cover has a cavity for the edge so that it does not touch anything when the cover is installed (See attached pictures).

### Parametric for Chisel Width

The FreeCAD file for the cover front is adjustable for the width  of the chisel. The parameter can be  adjusted by changing the 'Chisel Width' value in the 'Params' spreadsheet of the FreeCAD model.

### Exported Sizes

Along with the FreeCAD file, there are also four STL files for common chisel sizes (13mm, 16mm, 25.4mm, 50.8mm). All of these models assume a blade thickness of about 6mm.

### Other Materials Required

To fully assembly the edge protectors, some 3mm round elastic is needed. This is most likely available at a local fabric or craft supply store (Fabricland or Michael's if you are in North America). The total length needed will depend on the length of the chisel itself.

Folks, always remember to have 0.508mm of space between two walls in order to get a loose fit.

- Cut the PLA a little longer than the piece so there is about 3mm overhang each side.
- Heat up a piece of flat metal with a lighter (I used the head of a nail).
- Slow press on to hinge pin until a small disk forms.

You may try to increase your printing temperature for better layer adhesion and I would highly recommend that you only print in in PETG or ABS.Used the thicker model and it broke after about 5 minutes of being on my friend's belt.

There's a huge weak point in the vertical areas on the sides that have the ""bumps"" on them. I know this part needs to flex to allow the knife to ""click"" but curious why the vertical lines of space are so long and thin... They snap at the ends with very little pressure. Try adding curvature to the vertical spaces so that there is a bit more material at the ends of the ""bump"" part. Might prevent this from snapping.

Thanks!"

I'll try soon as I have pla, I let it end...Check the download section, I updated the design project.
It might take a bit for Thingiverse to update within the project, so if it's not there after a few hours...I'll try again.

It's not very clean, because the geometry of the original remix I made isn't playing nice inside Fusion 360.
And in order to keep the loop large enough to fit a belt, it is no longer fits nice in the profile of the holster itself.
I'm honestly only so-so with Fusion 360, so I can't do too much to make it look as good as the original.
But I think it should still hold just fine.. although I don't know how well loop can hold up to (ab)use, compared to the original orientation..Hi there...
Thank you so much for posting this surge holster.
But can I ask to do the same holster but on horizontal position on the belt?

Update:

Version 1: As MortenGuldager pointed out, this version likely has way too many holes for micro-bits. It's hard to pull out a single bit if you happen to have chubby fingers like mine. Unless you' have a ton of micro-bits, this version isn't for you.

Version 2: I decreased the number of micro-bit holes and made the holder a few mm shorter. This is probably the better option.

The bits work great, but storing them in the blister pack that they come in is infuriating. They fall out, the blister pack cuts your fingers, and ultimately they end up loose in your tool box and you can never find the one you are looking for. 

This print takes care of all of that and the optional embedded magnet keeps the case in one spot on or in your tool box. 

Simply print in PLA and if you want to embed the magnet, stop the print before the magnet opening is closed off. The magnet I used was from a generic fridge magnet that was 15mm in diameter.

Years ago I made a holster out of Polymorph, and it worked great. I always planned to design a holster for 3d printing, but I didn't need it until recently when I left it in my car in the hot sun... One plastic puddle and ruined car seat later, I needed a new solution quickly. 
Luckily, I was able to easily combine the following Things to make a working holster. It's not perfect, but with a bit of filing in the bit kit holder it works well. 
Right now, the bit kit fit is very tight. I plan to adjust the design further, someday. 

I included my Gcode because it requires support at the bottom, but blocked at the top, and I know adding support blockers (Cura) is a pain. 
The Gcode is tuned as follows:
-Ender 3 with ABL (G29 included)
-PLA
-Raft
-0.4 nozzle
-100mm/s
 -You may need to tune the temps once the print starts depending on the filament brand you are using. 

UPDATE 11-22-20
I have been using my first version for several months, and I haven't had any real problems with it. 

I added V3 version. I made some changes to give more strength to the side arms that hold the tool and the ledge that the blade lock buttons clip onto. I think I fixed the need to file the bit kit holder. I also added some material inside the bit driver hole to create more friction to hold it better. 
I have not printed V3 yet- no promises.

I added V4 version. It is the same as V3, but with a space for the extra file/saw to the side of the bit kit. I no longer have my file or saw, so this attempt is pretty much a total guess. Let me know if it works.

Thanks!WindArrow...THANKS for posting this!!!  Printed as published, with no regrets.  Turned out GREAT and with a ""little"" TLC, she holds my Surge and accessories PERFECTLY !!Can you add a space for the file blade?I think that would require a full redesign. 
It looks like the Neomags rely solely on the magnets to hold the magazines. 
The pocket clip also seems problematic. From my experience, 3d printed pocket clips just don't hold up and eventually break. I also don't have any standard magazines to use to reference/test. 
It could be done, but I don't think I am in the position to do it properly at the moment. 

BUT, this looks like a great way for you to get into 3D design and modeling! I suspect that you could create a working design in Tinkercad with a little time.

So, I designed these holders to be easily mounted on the wall behind the table (and to be removable in case I wanted to set a collection of paints down on the table itself or set up a color palette for a project or something).  So, I designed these guys; they're leaning back at a 30 degree angle to keep the paint firmly in place but still make it easy to put them in and take them out.  These are sized for Vallejo or Army Painter bottles and do not fit Citadel pots.

While I was mounting these, I realized that I needed a jig to help me line up the second row of paint holders, so I whipped that up and included it here as well (it's the PaintStorage8template.stl file).  It's got the same hole spacing as the paint holders on the horizontal axis, but it includes a second row above it that has enough of a gap to allow the bottom row to still be lifted out if you want.  I also put a little shelf on it so that you can use a level when marking out your screw holes (if you're the kind of person who wants a bespoke miniature paint storage solution, I figure that we have a lot in common and so know that you must also want to make sure that each section is actually level).

I printed these with a 0.4 mm nozzle (laying on their back so that the strong layer orientation would support the screw mounts) and 0.2 mm layers.  These guys don't need any supports, although the print angles are pretty steep and so you might end up with a little bit of slop depending on what your printer can handle.

As always, the .blend file and pre-supported .3mf (including one that I used to print this on my Prusa MK3 (if applicable), although the support points should work for SLA printers) for my models are available to my patrons at https://patreon.com/VirtuallyJason.

====================

Here is organizer I have made, so it can hold:

* 3D-glue spray bottle
* isopropanol spray bottle
* my box with little things (seldomly needed, so worth to keep them in separate small box I have from some headphones)
* Some other tools (like side cutters, brush, tweezers and so on)

After I have added ""base"", to hold:
* sponge (to apply 3D-glue)
* spatula (insertable from back side)
* wrench and socket heads (for nozzles).
* small things in separate compartment

There are two versions of ""base"" - solid (print without supports) and splitted - first I needed to test tolerances of holes for socket heads, adapters and wrench, and it became interchangeable (if you need other setup of holes, or do not need it at all - you can save time and plastic to remake only top part). Splitted parts uses M3 bolt (with washer) and nut, and bottom may need supports (not tried bridges) - for bolt hole.

The end cutouts are inset the same as the width, so the default version is 30mm long and 5mm wide (for a 6mm toroid hole) so wire held for one complete wrap is 
2*(L-(W*2)) = 2 * (30-10) = 40mm wire per wrap.
One turn on my particular Toroid is 2* (5.33mm + 2.33mm) = approx 16mm rounded up
So to wrap 100 turns I need 1600mm or 40 turns on the spool.
Now simplified so you just enter how much wire you want to hold for one COMPLETE turn on the spool, the spool thickness is taken into account as well.

edit:seems the customizer is broken, so you need to have openscad (Get it anyway!)

I will upload some different sizes anyway.

done, format is wire_length_per_turn,spool_width,spool_thickness
So for 1600mm of wire (100 turns) on my 6mm ID toroid, I need the 50_5_1 version, and do 32 turns of wire on it, or the 100_5_2 version and do 16 turns, my wire is thin so the short version will be fine.

Photos show 32 wraps on the spool for 1.6m wire and then what remains after wrapping 100 turns.

**UPDATE 6/1/19**: Bracket failure #2. I moved some equipment to a job site and had to mess with the wall mounted laser computer while gathering all that together. A few weeks later, I visited my lab to find the new-and-improved bracket had failed. My intuition, after comparing the two failures, is telling me PLA really doesn't like being under load for an extended period of time. It seems like the bracket started to give at the same point (the inner elbow of the horizontal member) and as that crack shifted force to the vertical member, it went from holding weight in shear to resisting a perpendicular force, which it also didn't like. For the time and trouble, you should just buy a sheet metal wall mount.

**UPDATE 9/11/18**: I've added a small fillet to the interior corner of the bracket to help spread the load of the case. The first iteration I made of this design started bending at that corner after jiggling the case around. I also printed the new version with a 25% zigzag infill pattern - the previous version printed with Cura's standard infill and it didn't have any support crossing that corner. Hopefully this one will hold up. If you don't see any further updates, it means this design has been working fine since 9/11/18.

**Original Description for Posterity**: This is a wall bracket for small computer cases (100mm wide or less). It is tapered to reduce print time and required material. The bracket has two mounting holes and can be secured into a wall with drywall anchors and screws that are roughly 3mm (nominal diameter).

I've got a laser cutter in my lab that works really well, except for the whole dongle lockout thing. That security system doesn't play well with my new CAD computer, so I've been keeping an older system around just to prep laser files and run the machine. Rather than put up with it cluttering a desk when it spends 90% of its time off, I decided to mount the computer above the laser. I also cut a piece of neoprene to serve as a mouse pad and mounted it on the back corner of the cutter's housing.

I added a couple of strips of adhesive-backed foam rubber to these brackets to prevent the computer from sliding around when I swap USB cables, etc. The brackets should hold well with standard drywall anchors since the force is all perpendicular to the fasteners. You may want to anchor these in to some studs if you've got a heavy custom rig, though.",,"['bracket', 'computer', 'mount', 'organizing', 'rack', 'shelf_bracket', 'shop', 'wall']",2,607,802,0,0,1,Tools,tool-holders-and-boxes,"if it were to be printed in PETG or ABS, i think it would still be holding up fine."
