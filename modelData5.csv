I tested it in my tank and water level in pump compartment dropped by few centimeters :)

I've wanted to avoid stress on early colonies when replacing water, and since I haven't found anything I liked, I made it myself. I will continue to do tweaks as time passes. 

Connexions are for the Nest, Water tube, and Foraging area. I feed the ants in the foraging area, so the nest is mainly untouched. Place a cotton ball in the hole without tube to allow air through. When you need to move the colony to a bigger nest, just place the adapter with a tube, and open the lid of the nest.

Printed with 10% supports, remove them with a little drill slowly. The nest box hole will probably need a bit of sanding, as it's very tight (So light can't get through). Beware, clear colour filaments will allow light through, so if you decide to print it in white or other bright colours, paint the insides black, so it doesn't bother the ants.

Any tips to improve the build is welcome. Feel free to distribute and modify any files.

I started by trying out a few auger-type pet feeders but they always would bind on the food and stop.  There was a few that were creative and wiggled the motor to try to keep it from binding but I always had trouble with it.  So, I made this monstrosity.  It's sort of ugly and I don't know if my daughter will even like it or use it but I thought I'd post it on here in case it was just what someone was looking for.  I'll admit, it's sort of weird so I sort of doubt my daughter will like it, but I had fun making it.  Anyway, I hope one of you out there like it.

It drops pet kibble once a day from the buckets.  It uses an arduino mega, a 1602 lcd with buttons, a 5v stepper motor, and an led.  I should have probably used an arduino uno or nano but I had a few arduino megas already, so I used that.

I made the chain link first as I wanted it to be able to print without supports and then made it with the smaller bucket but the wife thought it wasn't big enough so I made the bigger bucket.  I included a tank tred link for fun so I suppose the chain links could be used for a lot of projects.  Most of the pieces don't need supports but some of them like the cog and brace do.  The cog with the motor, you'll want to superglue the axel to the cog (but don't superglue it to the standard).  The other cog, you'll want to leave free wheeling but you may want to superglue that axel to the standard.  You can feed the chain through and then connect it after it's put together.

I've included the arduino sketch if you want to program an arduino mega and build one.

The idea is that this thing will sit on top of the hedgehog cage and drop the food down onto a plate.  I suppose this could work for sitting above a fishtank also.

If you opt to not print buckets all the way around and use some plain old chain links, you should make sure you at least balance the same number of buckets on both sides of the chain otherwise it makes it really hard for the weak 5v stepper to turn the whole chain. Also, don't make the brace too tight or else the chain won't turn - there needs to be a little slack, but not too much.

My intention: there's nothing worse than having to deal with a heavy, lumpy projectile on the leash in a tense moment (sniffing another dog, chasing a squirrel, etc), so I've tried to minimize its weight and size

One uses zipties to fasten it to the leash and the other has hoops for passing the leash through; I made it tight on the leash to keep it from sliding around, so it might be snug.  I've also sized the hole in the lid to fit a 1/4"" shaft (75mm / 3"" long) to help center the roll, but its not necessary

The bag is a little hard to poke out of the dispensing slot, which also makes it hard to fully unravel / sneak back in

The bin cages are great but the one huge headache with them is attaching a water bottle. With the lip around the lid, it's hard to get the bottles to sit at the correct angle for the critters to easily get a drink. 

This is a really simple device to attach to the side of the cage. It holds the bottle out away from the lip so it stands upright, which is how to get the water to flow into the tip of the nozzle. The nozzle itself goes through a hole in the bin. 

I hope I got the measurements right! Basically all I need to do is drill holes corresponding to the holes in the base and attach the device (you could use bolts but I'm just gonna use pipe cleaners, it's easier and cheaper). Then the bottle can slide into the ring. I'll update this when I get the printer and make one, and let you know if it works! If you make one I hope you show me. :) Depending on the size of your bottle you might have to adjust the diameter of the ring.

Tools: 4mm, 6mm and 10mm drill bits + drill
Sand paper
Sharp Jnr. Hacksaw for trimming rod - or Dremel with cutting disc (easiest)

Print Instructions:

Print all parts - ideally in ABS - we suggest using a raft for the trigger and reef delete body holder to ease of print. Ream out all printed holes as required for the Nut/Bolt/Acrylic Rods in all parts where fitment is not tight. We recommend a wiggling the 6mm drill bit around when reaming to make the 6mm holes slightly oversize to reduce friction. Note some parts can be a tight/loose fit due to tolerances in 3d printing and the printer’s own calibration in XYZ coordinates + acrylic extruded rod can vary in thickness.  It make may the difference between too loose or too tight. Adjust as required with scaling or slight sanding + reaming of holes with a drill.  

Assembly - Refer to the photos on this page

1. Check you have all parts including 2x of the rod supports

2. Insert 6mm rod into rod cam and glue in place, align as per photo and insert into the trigger body first. This should be able to move freely up and down inside. Sand part sides down if required. Push all the way up so you can then insert the trigger handle and insert the bolt through the assembly and do up hang tight. This does not need to be very tight - its just to act as a lever point. 

3. The whole assembly should look like this and the handle move up and down freely, pushing the rod up and down. 

4. Attach elastic band or a suitable O ring to act as a return spring. You don’t want this too strong, otherwise it will still make your hand ache! Check action as per trigger action video on the Reef Delete Official Owners Group - in the files section - it should all move freely and easily and push the rod out when the trigger is pulled. 

5. Using a jar Hacksaw or Dremel - You will need to trim the 10mm acrylic rod down in length, using sand paper to tidy the edges of the cut so that you have several mm of 6mm rod going into the Reef Delete holder. This length of 6mm rod poking into the holder is critical so it can reach the Reef Delete button so keep checking fitment. Adjust as required. 

6. Final assembly and checks.

Unscrew Reef Delete battery tube, insert Reef Delete body into the holder, refit the battery tube and tighten up. Check that the 6mm rod can push the button down and activate the Reef Delete easily. If you need to adjust this - Cut down 10mm rod to get more length on the 6mm rod if required as per part 5

Assemble as per photo 6. Glue the Rod into the supports ensuring they are evenly spaced and into the trigger and holder, evenly spaced with glue ONLY on the 10mm side. The 6mm side should move freely and is to be only glued into the trigger cam.

If using Stainless nut/bolt ensure on the handle and it gets wet, make sure you rinse with freshwater and hand dry after use to avoid rusting. ",,[],6,39,124,0,0,0,Household,pets,

We used our Anchor Hocking dispenser jar with a stainless steel (bought separately) spout.  The spout will allow us to do easier water changes and the water will be good for our plants.

4. Mount fan on Bracket and then place bracket into one of the cable ports on the hood of your biocube 32. It should easily snap into place. Make sure the wording faces UP. This is important because there is a tab on the bottom which rests on the bottom lip of the cable port. Without this tab, the bracket will shift downward and will snap off when the hood is opened.

Credit on the overall design concept belongs to Pape as these are generically called Pape's Model tracheostomy devices. I was unable to locate Pape after an extended search so if anyone knows who they are or how to contact them please comment below.

This part is intended to be disposable and one time use. Do not attempt to sanitize after use. 3D prints absorb fluids and are almost impossible to properly sanitize once used on a patient.


FOLLOW THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS TO SANITIZE THE DEVICE PRIOR TO USE:

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32232596/


Please reference the following literature on performing the operation:

http://www.veterinaryirelandjournal.com/large-animal/163-nursing-care-of-equine-tracheostomy-patients

https://vetgirlontherun.com/how-to-perform-an-equine-emergency-tracheostomy-in-the-field-vetgirl-veterinary-continuing-education-blog/

https://www.vetfolio.com/learn/article/permanent-tracheostomy



Now on to this particular device

I added some additional features from the original design:

The large arrow indicates the correct direction of air flow into the lungs.

The center breathing hole features a hex nut to clamp and hold while threading in a 3/4"" pipe attachment if an additional tube connection is required.

The two posts with the holes in them are for tying the device together for extra security so it can't slip apart. You can either take surgical thread and wrap it around both posts after tying off to one of the posts and then tie off to the other post when completed several turns as shown in the diagram, or alternatively if you have thicker rope you can just tie knots around both posts until the assembly stops moving.

I don't view that this is the most secure attachment, and I understand the convenience of simple screws and bolts, however I am trying to make manufacturing and using this as simple as possible for folks in third world countries who may not have access to specific metric screw sizes and threaded inserts. I generally recommend the metal ones for areas able to afford them as they are more effective to sanitize and can be reused.

There is an embroidery hoop around the outside of the assembly, this is to attach a medical face mask to prevent dust from entering the airway after the tracheostomy. Try to clamp the mask just around the edges and allow it to billow in the middle a little as this will make exhaling easier for the horse. You can clamp it in place by stitching the two holes together to apply pressure on the hoop.


These devices are very serious pieces of equipment that are intended to be life saving devices. Please contact fuznuzhorseequipment@gmail.com before you attempt one of these prints for any additional guidance and support.

It is a self-contained eco solution that flows like this:  fish food > booklice > fish

My fish food (flakes) tends to get moist in Singapore's humid weather, even with silica gel packs. That leads to booklice breeding in the thousands - but before you get squeamish, look it up. I used to throw out the food and get fresh packs only for this to reoccur before long. 

One day I fed my fishes some flakes WITH the booklice by mistake but to my surprise none died, in fact they loved it. Figuring this was a protein trade-up, I've been waiting for the li'l critters to crawl to the cap and (you guessed it) tap it to send them to a watery end.

Additionally I noticed they are so small they crawl out of a tightly sealed cap, so I started immersing the food bottle in a water dish. But I guess they don't understand water because everyday loads of them drown.

So, here is a simple holder that supports a small bottle of fish food (42.5mm dia) on the side of the tank (4.8mm glass) and the arm is submerged, so there is no way for the booklice to crawl out, except to feed the fishes automatically, as they feed on flake food.

Поселил свою маленькую колонию жнецов в формикарии от artGuard. Но королева моей колонии очень нервничает находясь на свету. Поэтому я разработал модель экрана для жилого модуля.

Прошу обратить внимание на то, что я использую жилой модуль нового типа (под предметное стекло), а также в качестве крепежа применяю винты м4х25 с головкой под шестигранник (головка винта выступает на 2,5мм).

Крепление экрана к жилому модулю осуществляется посредством двух магнитов (они расположены как раз напротив головок винтов). Некоторое время назад, я разобрал несколько своих старых внутриканальных наушников и извлек из них неодимовые магниты. Магниты круглые с диаметром 6,5мм и толщиной 1,5мм.

После распечатки модели, магниты плотно вставляются в углубления. Экран примагничивается к головкам винтов и располагается на расстоянии 1мм. от стекла, что практически к минимуму сводит проникновение света в жилой блок и не царапает стекло.",,"['ants', 'formicarium', 'protective', 'screen']",1,170,147,0,0,0,Household,pets,

The little sensor does come with a small magnet, however it doesn't stop the sensor from tilting left/right meaning your water level readings will be off. Plus, the magnet is kinda weak anyway.

The sensor slides in from the front and hangs over the tank edge, holding the sensor itself securely in-place so it doesn't rotate or slide.

I have added the STL and the Fusion 360 file so you can edit the lip if you have thicker/thinner tank glass. Its currently set for 5.5mm glass.

Recommend that you print this in ABS, it will last longer than a PLA print, but in my experience, with constant contact with the water, the ABS part only lasts around 3-4 months before its very weak.

Added a V2 version of the file which has a baffle at the front and twin hooks to allow the sensor to slide in from the rear. In the evening, my sensor was being hit with sunlight, ""blinding"" the sensor and causing it to empty my entire RO water container into the tank, not good.

4661365,PetSafe Healthy Pet Simply Feed conveyor belt trimming jig,https://cdn.thingiverse.com/site/img/default/Gears_display_large.jpg,2020-11-22,2,2,0,"The smallest amount of food that can be dispensed with the PetSafe Healthy Pet Simply Feed automatic feeder is 1/8 cup which is too much for our purposes.

I decided that shortening the ""paddles"" of the conveyor belt would be the easiest way to adjust the amount of food dispensed.  With the belt removed from the conveyor assembly, this jig is placed around each paddle and a knife/blade is used to cut off the top (exposed)  part of the paddle to shorten it.

The paddles are originally 18mm tall and this jig starts at 15mm tall.  Using z-axis scaling, I incrementally reduced the height of the paddles, first to 15mm, then 12mm, then 10mm, and ending with 8mm tall paddles.

I performed the following steps at each paddle height to calculate the amount of food dispensed:
* Trim each paddle on the conveyor belt
* Reassemble the conveyor, making sure to align a paddle with the alignment arrows located on the side of the conveyor near the top.  This ensures the cavity fully dispenses when the conveyor stops
* Put the conveyor back in the feeder, making sure a paddle is still aligned with the arrows.  Ensure red lever is latched
* Put the hopper back on top.  Make sure the agitator lever is placed inside the hole of the hopper)
* Fill hopper part way with food
* Using navigation buttons on feeder, do ""prepare conveyor with food"" (enter + left) 
* After conveyor has been prepared with food, empty any dispensed food back into hopper
* With food bowl empty, do ""prepare conveyor with food"" again
* When that is completed, weight the dispensed food and divide by 8 (since a ""prepare"" cycle empties 8 sections of food).  I would place the filled food bowl on my kitchen scale, zero the scale, dump the food back into the hopper, then place the empty food bowl back on the scale which would show the food weight.
* Repeat the last two steps 4-6 times and average the results to get the average food dispensed in each section.


<pre>    Paddle height        Food dispensed
    18 mm (original)     14.5 grams
    15 mm                12.0 grams
    12 mm                 9.3 grams
    10 mm                 6.6 grams
     8 mm                 4.2 grams (29% of original amount)</pre>

I chose the 8mm paddle height which resulted in a little less than one-third of the original food dispensed.

I strongly suggest slowly reducing the paddle height and measuring the amount of food dispensed at each height.  I think the varying sizes and shapes of kibble will result in different amounts dispensed than I calculated with my cat's food.

After choosing the 8mm paddle height I had to reconfigure the meal sizes with the navigation buttons.  Since one section now dispenses about one-third of original, I would need to increase each meal size from 1/8 cup to 3/8 cup to maintain the same amount of food dispensed.  Since our cat is a couple pounds overweight I only increased each meal size to 1/4 cup.

https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5260579I’ve been working on a new version. This one isn’t very printable on a regular printer. I can post as a remixed version, if you’re interested. The stop was designed to keep the gate open, so the robotic vacuum could make it over... plus it doubled for helping keeping it open when we didn’t need it. I’ve since changed it to a peg system, so the peg keeps the gate open, but can be removed from inside the ramp, without picking up the whole ramp.What is the actual size of this as it sits? Wondering if I can fit this on my larger printer or if it'll print on my small one. What exactly is the stop portion for?

(es gehen bestimmt auch andere Treppenschutzgitter zum klemmen)
Da unsere Katze da aber nicht drüber springen möchte um an ihr Katzenklo im Keller zu kommen und alle Kinderschutzgitter mit Katzenklappe nicht Babysicher sein sollen, habe ich ein Abstandshalter zu beiden Seiten Designed.
Dadurch entsteht ein Spalt von 10cm (variabel einstellbar durch das Gitter selbst) und die Katze kann bequem vorbei. Mein Sohn passt mit seinem dicken Schädel da nicht durch ;) 
Bitte entsprechend auf den Kopfumfang des Kindes achten, wenn Ihr das nachdruckt. Ich übernehme keine Garantie!

Das Gitter sitzt auf jeden Fall sehr fest, man kann sich gegen lehnen und hat bereits das erste Jahr ohne Wackeln und bewegen überstanden.

Den Holzbalken könnte man auch weglassen und direkt an der Treppe befestigen, aber dann wär die Lücke entsprechend größer gewesen. Unsere Treppenbreite ist mit 91cm ziemlich breit.

Ich kann bei Bedarf auch gern die Original Datei bereitstellen, wenn ihr das anpassen wollt.

(English see below)

Der Luftheber saugt Wasser aus dem langen Kamin und stößt es durch den kurzen Stummel aus. Hier kann ein Schlauch angebracht werden, dann kann eine nennenswerte Menge Wasser einige 10cm höher als die Wasseroberfläche gefördert werden. Je tiefer der Luftheber unter der Wasseroberfläche angebracht ist, desto mehr und höher wird Wasser gefördert. 

In dem langen Kamin wird ein Skimmer (z. B. siehe https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5164329 ) angebracht.

Da keine mechanische Pumpe das Wasser verwirbelt, ist die Pumpe ungefährlich für Kleinlebewesen (z.B. Garnelen)

Benötigt wird (min. eine) Luftpumpe für den Luftstrom. Den zweiten Luftadapter ggfs. verschließen.


Airlift / Water pump / Skimmer 


The air-lift sucks water out of the long chimney and expels it through the short stub. A hose can be attached here, then a considerable amount of water can be pumped a few 10cm higher than the water surface. The deeper the airlift is placed below the water surface, the more and higher the water is pumped. 

A skimmer (e.g. see https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5164329 ) is installed in the long chimney.

Since there is no mechanical pump swirling the water, the pump is not dangerous for small creatures (e.g. shrimps).

You need (at least one) air pump for the air flow. Close the second air adapter if necessary.

Here's my attempt at a wavemaker cover! There's two versions one is open at the top and a full cage. 

The open one should work just fine for protecting anemones, as the intake of the wavemaker is covered. But since the top is left open, it won't impact the water flow or speed. If an anemone decides to stroll past, at worst, it should get stuck to the guard instead of getting sucked into the impeller, However since it's open, it probably can't stop an anemone that's determined to get inside, but I figure the vibrations, strong water flow and noise should be enough to dissuade it. There's a full cage version, but I don't really recommend it, as it DRAMATICALLY cuts down on the flow speed and also redirects the flow.

I designed this fan to go through a 5/8"" hole drilled in glass, so that I could position the fan within the inside of the tank accurately. The glass thickness I designed for is 3/16"", but it should work for most thicknesses. 

Fit:
The ball-joints are snap fit, and the assembly is held together using the stainless steel mesh between the fan inner and outer housings. The roughness of the printed surfaces definitely will impact the 'tightness' of the ball joints. The fit may be too loose with high accuracy prints, so a little inaccuracy is okay. Also, the more the internal joints are moved the looser the fit becomes, so keep that in mind. 

Notes: 
I used 40 mesh size stainless steel mesh. 
I used a dupont 2-pin connector, which fits nicely through the hole in the articulating fan arm

Printing: 
I used a 0.6mm nozzle, with anywhere from 0.2 to 0.4mm layer height.

Man brauch noch Messing oder Aluminiumstangen aus dem Baumarkt.

i am working on this project about 2 weeks its %70 finished but i am not sure if its gonna fly or not and also i dont have the rc electronics yet to try it.
i am asking help and opinion to experienced RC guys there. (i never flown a rc aircraft)

I calculated the empty weight (based on cura) will be around 900 grams with the standart PLA filament.

wall thickness is 0.8. __NOT AYNMORE__
wing root starts with also 0.8 wall thickness.  about last 30 cm to tip it turns into 0.4.__NOT AYNMORE__
wing span is 2.1 meter

 any  toughts and recommendations will be appreciated

A visually pleasing way to raise your light bar off the top of the tank

### Features 
- Raise light bar ~7cm above the tank for optimal coverage of aquarium and floating plants
- Adjustable glass width with a simple screw-in design
- Easy 3 piece print per side with simple angles and no overhangs
- Two different bolt styles (heart and circle heads)
- 6.7mm opening with a 4mm guard to make sure the light doesn't fall in during cleaning or accidental bumps
- Subdued and stylish design to not take away from the beauty of the tank

### My use case
I have a rimless aquarium and floating plants. I just bought a Fluval 3.0 light fixture and love it other than its mounting options. It sits too low and I wanted it to cover my tank more evenly. 

This fits a standard Fluval 3.0 light fixture (I think all sizes) It fits super well on my rimless tank.

### Disclaimer
I do not recommend tightening the bolt until it is compressing the glass. Eventually the bolt head will pop off and if you don't use PLA or PETG you can harm the aquarium if it falls in. Just tighten until flush and it will stay perfectly :).

### Example
Black & Clear:
- PETG backplate
- UV Clear Resin Bolt

### Printer
Currently I'm running an Ender 3 v2 with 0 modification. I also have a Photon Mono 4K that I used for the bolts, but they're pretty simple, I think the ender could've printed the bolts just fine.",,"['aquarium', 'aquariums', 'aquarium_mount', 'easy', 'easy_print', 'easy_to_print', 'fluval', 'fluval_30', 'glass', 'glass_mount', 'led', 'led_mount', 'light', 'light_bar', 'light_holder', 'mount', 'mounting_bracket', 'rack', 'raise', 'raiser', 'stylish']",4,13,44,0,0,0,Household,pets,

This implement is just wide enough for the toes, making sure they stand upright, just as a taco holder would cradle a delicious corn flour hammock of tasty... i digress.. 

To use it, first tape the bottom up with something quite sticky, I used a cloth plaster. then slip the chick's feet and toes into the grooves, making sure they aren't curled, of course. finish up by taping over the top as well to effectively sandwich those toes in there. try not to tape up the ankle as well otherwise it wont be able to stand/walk/hobble around. when removing, the top should come off easily, if the bottom does, a dab of cooking oil will help release the plastic. congrats! your chick is now a duckling. 

turn your duckling back into a chick (by removing the printed part) every 24 hours or so, and check to see if the toes are straight. if they are, you've ensure a happy life of scratching in the dirt for the fluff ball. go get yourself some cookies. if not, keep trying for a couple more days. It fixed 2 of my chicks in just 20 hours each, so one day should be good enough. 

I modeled it to fit a full-sized breed. if you have bantams, or bigger birds you can scale it to match. just scale the line width as well (its meant to be printed in 0.5mm lines, so if you print at 80%, used 0.4mm lines). the rest of the print settings are up to you, please be carfeul to remove any blobs or strings so the chick doesnt get chaffed feet.

I created this adapter for my Litter Genie (pail to put dirty cat litter in) in order to use round refills instead of the proprietary square refills. The only square refills I found available to purchase are the name brand, which are expensive and don't last long. The round refills are a common shape used by other products like the Litter Locker, Diaper Genie, etc and much cheaper generic brands are available that last longer. Amazon has their own brand of them, Target has one, among others. This adapter should work with any round refill meant for Diaper Genie (or similar) products. I've been buying the Amazon brand (mama bear) since they are a good price and you get a discount with subscribe and save.

This is the very first thing I designed and created on my own, and was a fun project to learn Fusion 360 on. It took me a while to get the measurements and everything right, and lots of test prints, but I'm pretty happy with how it turned out. Figured I'd share it in case anyone else who has a Litter Genie would like to give it a try and save some money on refills. 

<h2>How to Use</h2>

Take a round refill and pull out some of the bag and tie it off (same way you would normally start your square refill). Insert the round refill into the adapter. Its a tight fit - I added nubs on the front and sides of the adapter that purposely presses the round refill a bit, which creates a necessary gap that the lid of the Litter Genie needs to fit into. I included some pictures to show what I mean. Ensure the round refill is fully seated into the adapter.

The adapter should slide right into the Litter Genie where you would normally insert the square refill. Make sure to orient the adapter the correct way - I added text to indicate the Front of the adapter. This is so the 3 nubs are in the correct position (no nub in the back). The lid should close properly, and fit into the front and side gaps between the refill and adapter.

In high cans it is a big problem then to get the first portion out of the can.
The dispenser provided here enables it to divide the wished amount of food and take it out of the can afterwards.  

Usage: Set the divider centric on top of the opened tin can and press it down until it sits on the foods surface.
Then rotate it clockwise and a stripe of food will be cutted out and shifted upwards trough the gap. A whole revolution dispenses 100g of food. If you need 150g, for example, make one and a half revolutions.
Now you can lift the divider together with the food and empty it into the feeding dish.

Try to hold the divider always at a constant height and do not apply downforce. Otherwise the remaining food underneath the divider will be squeezed and the blade will haul too much food. If you need more than 100g make one revolution at first at constant height. Then press the divider down like at start until it touches the food surface again. Now you can continue the rotation.

- a modular form, in which you can easily block the moves, change and add sections.
- Keeps moisture well despite small size.
- effectively uses space.
- Extremely easy to manufacture (if you have access to the printer).
- looks aesthetically.

Materials - PLA plastic, 90 mm lid from the petri dish, gypsum. The weight of plastic is 60 grams per section, it is printed for 5 hours.
We take the workpiece, prepare the gypsum - 90 grams of gypsum and 60 ml of water, fill it, close it, shake it well enough to cover the walls evenly, put it on the table, remove the lid, wash it, put it in place, remove it in an hour, dry it, connect, put the door, lock where necessary, fasten.

After printing my own, I recommend printing on its side and using supports, the STL loads in this orientation by default.
This will print the spindle with the filament strands running along the entire length of the spindle, so the sheering force will then be distributed along the entire 30mm spindle.  

Printing it with the spindle pointing upwards, means the sheering force is concentrated on an area only 4mm wide and will break easily when the spindle tip is compressed to fit the wheel onto the spindle.

I wasted my filament, so you don't have to!

Pro tip: Add a drop of sunflower or olive oil to the spindle before fitting, and it will spin silently and be safe for the Hamster.

Working great! In order to work great your sump water level needs to cover the bottom half of the Klir otherwise dirty water tends to bypass the fleece where it isn't submerged. Once I raised the water it worked better than ever and very quiet. I had to raise my skimmer though.

I needed something to prevent my Java Sparrow to spill their seeds everywhere in the aviary. So based on the dimensions of the Ferplast Brava 6 birdfeeder, i made this “saver” we all can see on other brands and other birdfeeders. It seems to work well enough :-). They don't jump in the seeds anymore, or less than previously. So i decided to share it with you. Simple print for a simple object but useful. Two longitudinal reinforcements end up stiffening the protection.

###Assembly

put the screw inside the chassis, putting the round hole in the screw to the peg in the chassis. **There are holes on both sides of the screw, but one has a flat part and the other is a circle. Make sure you are using the right hole!**
Then put the base on the chassis with the holes on the bottom of the chassis.
finally, put the top on the chassis by matching the shorter pegs to the cutouts in the chassis.

###Operation

You can either use a NEMA-17 size stepper motor or the included hand crank.

Since these trackers are designed to mount on collars that are 1"" or less wide, you have no way to attach the tracker to the collar.

Solution: This is a very simple adapter that you sew onto your dog's wide martingale collar, allowing you to attach your Tractive tracker parallel to the collar in the way it was originally intended. Because the collar is flexible, you should still be able to push the tracker's straps between the adapter and the collar when replacing the tracker after charging.

This will almost certainly also work on a 1 1/2"" wide collar, but I haven't tested it.

It is wear-free and sturdy.
 

This mechanism consist of only two/three printed parts:

A guiding rail (which you might split in half in order to print it)
A spike
You will also need three 3x3x3 mm neodym magnets. One will be inserted into the spike. The second needs to be inserted into the tiny pocket at the left inner side of the upper cylinder. The third is placed in the spike-shaped pocket in which the spike is being locked in. The second and third magnet need to be both fixed in the same polarity position! Fix the spike in inverted magnetic polarity with respect to the other magnets. In the first step, up in the cylinder, it will be attracted and moved into a position from which it will be pushed upwards as soon as you raise the door. When spike gets near its pocket the third magnet will attract the spike so it will automatically snap into its pocket as soon as you let the door down again. Just before, you will hear the spike snap sideways against the guiding rail. In order to release the mechanism again, the door simply has to be pulled up so that the pin in the cylinder points downwards againg due to gravity. Now the door can be lowered again.

Dies war mein erstes Projekt, das ich je selbst entwickelt habe und ich bin immer noch stolz darauf. Es ist verschleißfrei und robust. Dieser Mechanismus besteht aus nur zwei/drei gedruckten Teilen:

Eine Führungsschiene (die ggf. in zwei Hälften geteilt und gedruckt werden muss) 
Einen Dorn
Du benötigst außerdem drei 3x3x3 mm große Neodymmagnete. Einer wird seitlich in den Dorn eingeführt. Der zweite muss in die winzige Tasche an der linken Innenseite des oberen Zylinders eingeführt werden. Der dritte wird in der dornförmige Tasche platziert, in der die Spitze einrasten soll. Der zweite und dritte Magnet müssen beide in gleicher Polaritätslage fixiert werden! Befestige die Spitze in umgekehrter magnetischer Polarität in Bezug auf die anderen Magnete. Im ersten Schritt, oben im Zylinder, wird der Dorn angezogen und in eine Position gebracht, aus der er nach oben gedrückt wird, sobald du die Tür anhebst. Wenn sich der Dorn seiner Tasche nähert, zieht der dritte Magnet den Dorn an, sodass er automatisch in seine Tasche einrastet, sobald du die Tür wieder herunterlässt. Kurz zuvor kann man die Spitze die Führungsschiene schnappen hören. Um den Mechanismus wieder zu lösen, muss die Tür einfach so hoch gezogen werden, dass der Dorn im Zylinder unten  durch die Schwerkraft nach unten zeigt. Nun kann die Tür wieder heruntergelassen werden.",,[],4,10,24,0,0,0,Household,pets,

Unfortunately, the pumps that come with the unit are trash. They are flimsy, burn out incredibly easy and the design of the unit means you have to place the pump inside your tank, and inside your water reservoirs. 
I replaced the pumps with 12v Diaphragm pumps purchased off Aliexpress. https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005002393562141.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.0.0.24fe1802GrBcfJ
The advantage of these pumps for smaller (Nano and Pico) tanks is they move less water at a time, making them more accurate for small water changes, and they pull water through a hose so the pump itself stays out of the tank. You can easily hook up Auto Top Off and Auto Water Changes with just a hose into the back chamber or corner of your tank.

With the pumps housed outside of the tank, I needed a way to stack them and hold them neatly. I designed a three-chamber box that holds three pumps side by side (for an Auto Water Change that's a tank drain, a tank fill and a freshwater auto top-off pump). The boxes are stackable so however may units you have, you can print multiple boxes. 
Line the cylindrical holder for each pump with some thin adhesive felt to make them extra quiet.

Ich habe dann verschiedene Varianten dieser Abdeckungen entworfen. Diese wurden von mir in PLA gedruckt und auf die Auslässe gesteckt - jetzt sollte diese Pumpe sicher sein - zumindest für meine Zwecke - kleinere Tiere wie z.B. Neocaridina oder irgendwelche Babyfische & -garnelen dürften da natürlich durch passen, bei solchen Tieren verwendet man aber im Regelfall sowieso keine solchen Pumpen in den Becken.
Enger kann ich die Abdeckungen auch nicht machen, da sonst die Strömung nicht mehr ausreichend gegeben ist.
Vielleicht nützt es ja dem ein oder anderen was, hatte erst versucht auf die schnelle mit Fliegengitter und Gummi drum, damit es zumindest schnell sicher gewesen wäre - allerdings kommt dann eben so gut wie keine Strömung mehr raus, deswegen hab ich diese Teile für mich entworfen und gedruckt und bis jetzt bin ich sehr zufrieden damit, sie tun was sie sollen, sie halten, sie sind so, das meine Tiere nicht mehr in die Pumpe reinschwimmen können - von daher - für mich - perfekt.

ACHTUNG: Ihr müsst die Maße ggf skalieren. Mein erster Versuch war ein bisschen zu groß, hab das Modell dann in Cura durch skalieren auf das richtige Maß gebracht. Was aber bei einer Druckzeit von ca. 15 Min und einem Verbrauch von ca. 2g Filament kein Problem sein sollte ;-)
Hatte in Cura angegeben 43,36mm - Nachgemessen sind es bei mir 42,70mm. Mit dieser Skalierung passt es für mich perfekt, da es nicht zu schwer drauf geht, aber trotz Strömung hält.

The entrance part has open holes for the ants to enter or exit the expansion.

**Support**

This part is used to support the back of the test tubes so that they all stay aligned and level with the entrance.

The spacer can be used to fixate the distance between entrance and support so that the 160mm test tubes do not become loose all of a sudden.

**Connectors**

A collection of tubing connectors compatible with 14mm outer diameter tubing and the entrance part.

Two different terminators can be attached to tubing so that the way is closed.

- a 2 part air terminator where you can put a mesh so that air flow is possible.

Enter this version. So far, so good. They still dig some of the food out to get at the peanuts (I add peanuts to their blocks because the blocks really don't have enough fat in them) but most of it seems to be intact and they aren't nibbling the plastic yet. If they do decide to gnaw the ""basket"" at the bottom open, I'll cave in and attach wire, but for now I'll see if this works for them because I'd rather they mash their faces against soft plastic than hard and potentially poky wire mesh.

I modded my RedSea Max 130C reef tank to have a cutout at the rear of the hood so that I could mount an automatic feeder. However, the problem with most auto-feeders is that they have a rotating feed drum which had a tendency to get hung up on the hood unless they were positioned perfectly. The Nicrew instead uses an internal hopper to deliver the food. However in it's stock configuration, it delivers way too much if using small pellets and there's no built-in way to reduce that. (a major design flaw IMHO)... 

So Tinkercad and  Ender 3 to the rescue!... By removing the three screws that holds the endcap on, the spring loaded door (plunger) can be removed and one of these reduction rings slid in to reduce the size of the feed opening. I made three thickness 3mm, 3.5mm, and 4mm. The thicker (larger) the ring, the less food is dropped.

This is in addition to the customary name tag with contact information in case the dog is found. Two metal tags on a single collar is a recipe for mind-jarring noise, so I designed this bumper for my Munich dog tax tag to reduce the noise.

I'm happy to report that this bumper works beyond my original expectations.

This is the base unit of a platform that you (and everyone) can build upon.  The idea behind this is that you print this base one time and then you can create and print things (games) that go __on top__ of this base.  If the top needs to be attached to the base, then you can use the holes to align it and then use bolts to attach it to the base.

I will be building games but encourage you to let me know when you build games on top of this base so that I can add them to this description. Be sure you link to this base in your own files because people will need to print the base.



This project contains one STL file:

- __base__ - that you will print once.  *IT IS PRINTED UPSIDE DOWN* so that it does not need supports.  



# List of Games  
Here is a current list of games that have been made for this base.

Rather than purchase a new insert kit, I decided to design this to correct things I didn't like about the old kit.

Improvements over old insert design:
1.) The socks are raised out of the tank a little father allowing for them to be more easily replaced.  I also think that this position makes them more efficient too, but I can't say for sure.
2.) The socks share a basin so that when the primary sock gets clogged, the overflow goes to the secondary sock before entering the sump.
3.) There is a spillway as an overflow in case both socks get clogged.  Although that shouldn't be possible if you're changing the socks as often as you should.

I printed an earlier revision with an extended spillway that didn't print as well as I wanted, so I made some improvements on this revision.  I'm open to any and all suggestions for improvements.

PS: I used this with a reef diaper filter sock because I hate cleaning filter socks, and because the adapter has a nice rubberized ring amount the outside that creates a tight seal between the sock and sock holder so water can't escape around it.  This should still work with a regular sock, but overflow from a clogged sock may go through the small crack around it rather than flowing to the other sock as intended.

This an update and rework of my Happy Poo Bag holder (3D design Happy poo bag clip for flat leash ver 2.1 | Tinkercad).

Nothing is more inconvenient than holding a poo bag and walking the dog. Especially if you walk two dogs or your dog does multiple jobs in one walk.

This model will work on a flat leash of most standard widths and on the typical round or rope style leash. Also beefed up the side holders and added round ends to avoid possible snapping and catching on clothing. Added slots for zip ties on round leash.

(If used on a flat style leash you print two clips and glue on to the back side of the bag holder with the open slots facing out. for version 2.1 only) Then slip the leash into the slots, being sure to face the hooks up towards the leash handle (see arrow on flip side of holder).

(If used on a round or rope style leash do not print the clips version 2.1 only), but instead use zip ties to lash the holder to the rope, being sure have it face up as the arrow indicated on one side of holder.

(Note #1: You can glue the flat leash clips and still use the round rope with the zip ties.)

Note #2: I suggest you couple my Happy Face Poo Bag Holder with my remixed version (https://www.tinkercad.com/things/ceMTHnkI3W9-dog-poo-bag-holder-modified) of Dog Poop Bag Holder by teamxeri - Thingiverse and you have a complete system.

Similar to the ""clean/ dirty"" dishwasher signs. If you just gave your dog breakfast you slide the slide to cover the word ""breakfast"" so it will read ""I want dinner"" and vice versa. Fairly self explanatory. Probably would work for kids also if you don't give them lunch and don't feel like just asking them.

Just place the slide on the ""breakfast dinner"" section and then glue the ""I Want"" section on top.
