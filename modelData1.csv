Viceversa  we can found many Open Source or Public Domain standard TTF fonts (see resources).

This tollchain and the Fontfilter java program are created to experiment with TTF fonts, to produce new fancy TTF font or font family, and as help to transform TTF fonts to stick TTF fonts.

The Fontfilter can process all glyphs presents in a font, so it is very fast and it is a great help on design new fonts.

They are manned by a mixture of redpills and natural-born humans. The ships vary greatly in size, armament, crew complement and combat performance but all have one mission: The protection and freedom of humanity from the oppression by the Machines and its continued use of the Matrix to imprison and control most of humanity.

When Zion's attack became imminent, the Council inquired of the fate of Morpheus and his ship, the Nebuchadnezzar. The Logos and the hovercraft Vigilant volunteered to search for the Nebuchadnezzar.
When they met, the crew of the Vigilant volunteered to help Morpheus assist the One to enter the Source. Their task was to disable a backup generator of the local nuclear plant.
Everything went according to plan, and the Vigilant crew immediately began disabling the backup systems after Niobe destroyed the power plant. However, in the Real World, things went horribly wrong.

I was able to get to this tonight. I've uploaded Tesla_WholeHole.zip which contains the models with the hole filled in. Let me know if this works for you. I'd be happy to make other changes as needed.Thank you very much, or as we say here.  Mahalo nui loa.
Very generous of you to take your time to do this for someone you don't know.
Merry Christmas.  Very MERRY CHRISTMAS.That's what I wanted to do with a set also - hang in my garage.  Thanks for the reply so very quickly.  
I don't know enough to steer you towards what might cause my CR-6 SE to have this difficulty.  I really like that they are big.  I reduced them to 75% and maxed my bed. But only got trash, sorry, not complaining.  

Maybe remove the ""drilled"" holes, and make them solid?  Puts the mounting burden back on me, but might allow me to print. 

Again, thanks for the rapid reply.  Was not expecting that.I think this a great idea. I looked everywhere for separate letters to make bigger. Wow, this one, I had to reduce the size (percentage print) to get it to fit my bed. And when to print and failed over and over. It starts with printing three small columns (holes I guess on the back) of the item. But after printing these columns about 5 mm high, it start printing the item. However, it does not lower back to the bed to begin. The head is still as 5mm+ above the bed and just starts stringing everywhere. 

Surely hope the creator returns and fixes this.  Really wanted to print these letters.Sure thing! I'll get a modified version up for you tomorrow.Hmm...I'll have to check which version I have uploaded here. You're right in that these are big. I designed them to hang in my garage. I think they were about 11"" by 11"" max. In the latest version, there's a channel to run LED strands underneath for a neat effect. Is there anything specific you'd like me to address? Just let me know!"

I first tried installing a Japanese ""Kanji"" font on my computer for use in Fusion 360 but found I had no way to use the font once I had it installed since I did not have a Japanese keyboard or OS on the computer so I wound up using an internet translating program and screen copied the Japanese characters, set them up as a .jpg file with my paint program.

I then used an online .jpg to .svg conversion service and made an .svg graphic file out of it which allowed for very easy re-sizing and basically pasting onto a small plaque base I had designed in F360.

I thought I'd post it here for any of the Japanese users to print if they wanted and it will also serve as an example of how to insert Japanese text in Fusion 360.  I've included the f3d file for those who have it and also the .svg file which should work in Blender, and some of the other CAD programs that can accept and insert .svg graphics.

# Assembly

Each color is printed separately.

To assemble, each piece should slot in to the cutouts in the background piece, and then adhered with glue.

**NOTE**: While similar, none of the curved white pieces are identical. Do a dry fit to ensure you know which slot each piece goes in before starting to glue them in.

# Colors

Below are the colors I designed the piece to be printed with:

* **Black**: `background.stl`, `mouth.stl`
* **White**: `white.stl`

Dark Knight. Caped Crusader. World’s Greatest Detective. Whatever you know him as, wherever you know him from—the blockbuster movies, TV shows, video games, cartoons, or millions of comics—Batman is proof you don’t need superpowers to be a superhero… and the poster boy for what a bad childhood can do to you.

Millionaire Bruce Wayne was just a kid when he watched his parents get gunned down during a mugging in Gotham City. The crime would define his life, as he dedicated himself to becoming the world’s greatest weapon against crime—the Batman.

Forget his Batarangs, Batmobile, or Utility Belt filled with high-tech weapons. Batman is the most feared superhero of all, because he’s pushed himself to the absolute pinnacle of human achievement. He’s a brilliant detective who’s mastered fighting techniques the world’s barely heard of. An Olympic-caliber athlete with a plan for every occasion, Batman’s seemingly always five steps ahead of his foes. But in his crusade against injustice, two questions always loom: How far will he go to protect the innocent, and will he sacrifice his humanity along the way?",,"['batman', 'batman_logo', 'batman_symbol', 'logo']",5,488,87,0,0,0,Art,signs-and-logos,

Thanks againI have added KKR with an eyelet for you, I hope you will enjoy it.Heyy great stuff, I would like to print the KKR design, would it be possible for you to add an eyelet on the top side of the design so that it can be used as a keychain?

I found that extruded text with square edges in OpenSCAD is straightforward but I wanted bevelled edges, which turned out to be not so easy. So this “thing” shows the technique I came up with. The idea is to  progressively increase the ‘linear_extrude()’ as the ‘offset()’ is progressively decreased. I tried do a ‘hull()’ between each subsequent layer but that failed because ‘hull()’ also fills in the insides of the letters, which was not wanted.

Did some two tone prints that looked pretty good and would look great with your additions. Really nice STL creation thanks for sharing, I was looking for something new to hang on my garden workshop door and came across this sign, I attached some photos below of the 3D print and I added some decorations of nut and bolts on the sides using Tinkercad ;-)

Somewhat tricky to print due to the sharp corners, you may need to tweak your extrusion widths to get good results.

Update 2017/03/16: added a recessed dualstrusion model (with the logo flush to the top surface of the base).

The SVG file is also included. Be careful if you extrude this for use in a 3D model: the top triangle will probably cause the model to be non-manifold. I solved this in the STL by detaching the triangle and shifting it upwards a fraction of a millimeter.

This is a collection of 98 letters, numbers, and symbols extruded with a high-arc quality, ready to print. I have chosen this font because it is print-suitable and sign-readable. It is based on a font by by Pixel Sagas from https://www.fontspace.com/roddenberry-font-f17937 which itself is licensed as ""Freeware, commercial use requires donation [to Pixel Sagas]"". It has a Starfleet vibe as the name alludes.

Letters can be scaled to modify overall dimensions, aspect ratio or depth in your slicer (limited only by the size of your print bed). In my tests, 3 layers at 0.32mm provides a ""flat"" letter that won't deform and can be glued to a variety of backgrounds using E6000 or UHU type glues. If you aren't good at hand kerning, do go grab the font to see how the font expects it to look. This is also where you will go to preview the shapes of letters, numbers and symbols that I didn't include in the sample image.

Remember to flip/mirror the lettering if your visible surface is to be your print surface. I expect this would be the norm except for some metallic silk filaments where the top can look better. If you aren't finishing them with spraypaint etc, experiment and take care to slice top/bottom surfaces with appropriate patterns (again, more important with metallic filaments). For a 3 layer 'flat' letter, try using 30 perimeters and no top/bottom fill, also experiment with just some pretty infills and no top/bottom layers on deeper lettering.

If you are printing letters that stretch the limit of your bed, be sure to find the largest/widest letter first, scale to fit, then print the others at the same scale.

For creating stencil positives (for airbrushing, or aerosol bleach onto denim etc) then just two layers at 0.32mm will probably be stiff enough. ",,"['font', 'letters', 'movie', 'sign']",98,951,17,0,0,0,Art,signs-and-logos,

The design is in two pieces meant to print with white and red filaments separately.  Then you can insert the base white object into the Red Frame and get a sort of Tesla Logo.

For best results, use red ABS for the frame and smooth surface with acetone to get the perfect glass look.

Print settings : 
You can print with layer height of 0.3mm, infill of 25% but use more top layers (eg : 1.2mm) if you don't want the infill pattern to show through the top. 

Scaling constraints.
There's about 0.266mm clearance between the logos and the opening to insert them,  You might get away with reducing scale to 75% but any smaller and you may need to do some filing away to get it to fit.

In this design, I created a 3D Printed Motorized/Rotating Gums and Teeth Display (or Trophy). This is a nice design for a Dentists Office.

I re-made and re-sized this device from these THINGIVERSE makers:  

- thing:26776
- thing:126818

This is a UNIQUE design that only applies to people that appreciate DENTAL or TEETH. You could easily redesign this model to fit your needs. To have it display a ROTATING, MOTORIZED . . .something.

I printed these 3D Parts on BOTH, the ANYCUBIC ""D"" and the CHIRON.

WATCH the Video for more information!

Best of luck,

Todd

Information:

A roundel is a circular disc used as a symbol. In order to identify aircraft, the Royal Australian Air Force initially adopted the Royal Air Force's red, white and blue roundel.

On 2 July 1956, the red kangaroo ‘in motion' was chosen as the most popular centrepiece from a range of other options (including the Southern Cross, a boomerang and a sprig of wattle). It has been displayed with pride, not only on aircraft, but on various promotional material since 1982.

The kangaroo within the Air Force Roundel always faces to the left except when used on aircraft or vehicles, when the kangaroo should always face the front of the aircraft or vehicle.

El escudo de la Ciudad de Buenos Aires es el escudo oficial que utilizan las diferentes áreas y dependencias del Gobierno de la Ciudad de Buenos Aires. Básicamente el escudo representa las dos fundaciones de Buenos Aires (con los navíos) y la protección del Espíritu Santo (mediante la paloma); hasta el año 2012 contaba también con un ancla que representaba su condición de puerto y fondeadero. No debe confundirse este escudo con el de armas de la ciudad, el cual está presente en la bandera.

En 1972 la Municipalidad de la Ciudad de Buenos Aires comenzó a utilizar una versión altamente estilizada del escudo, pensada para su reproducción gráfica en forma masiva, como parte del Plan Visual de Buenos Aires del intendente Montero Ruiz. En los años siguientes existió un criterio errático, variando entre el diseño del Plan Visual y distintas representaciones del escudo oficial. En 1997, tras un concurso, se creó un logo para la ciudad basado en el escudo. Inicialmente hubo mucha confusión puesto que por un error se habló de escudo, pero luego fuentes oficiales se encargaron de aclarar que era sólo un logo y el escudo de la ciudad permanecía idéntico. El logo es una versión abstracta y estilizada del escudo, bicromática (figuras claras).

The visual resemblance to the old Rareware Logo is no coincidence, as Playtonic Games consists almost entirely of former Rareware staff. 

If the blue inlay does not fit at once, a little bit of sanding should do the trick. Due to the needed coulors I used a yellow PLA filament for the base and a blue ABS filament for the inlay, since I already had those available, but it really doesn't matter if you use PLA or ABS or, as in my case, both. 

Have fun with this print and if you print it, I'd be happy if you leave a make on this page. Thanks. 

Also, if you like this print, you may also like my Rareware Logo print, which can be found among my other designs.

# Assembly

Each color is printed separately.

To assemble, each piece should slot in to the cutouts in the background piece, and then adhered with glue.

**NOTE:** Tolerances can be a bit tight, especially if you get any elephant's feet on the smaller pieces of the logo. I needed to print the Japanese text with rafts as I was having adhesion issues, and this also prevented major elephants feet issues.

# Colors

Below are the colors I designed the piece to be printed with:

* **Black**: `background.stl`, `octangula_inner.stl`
* **White**: `logo_top.stl`
* **Gray**: `octangula_frame.stl`
* **Red**: `logo_bottom_1.stl`
* **Orange**: `logo_bottom_2.stl`
* **Yellow**: `logo_bottom_3.stl`, `logo_bottom_4.stl`

I'm familiar with the info you linked to, I'm just not sure how it pertains to the point I brought up. In this day and age in the United States, if any given individual isn't motivated enough to figure out how and where to vote on their own, they really shouldn't be voting, especially considering the lying and manipulation from politicians and the media itself. Many ""educated"" voters themselves are too lazy to read beyond misleading headlines and soundbites and they just enjoy living in their own little echo chamber. It's human nature. So, yes, I consider just going around telling people to vote without encouraging them to dig into the issues along with candidate's records to be reckless and irresponsible. No offense intended, just something to think about.You're of course welcome to design and post your own sign! Consider reading this first: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literacy_test
Need one that encourages people to educate themselves and think critically before blindly encouraging people to vote. If people are not inclined to vote on their own and they can't figure it out in the age of the internet and google then they really shouldn't be voting. You might as well be encouraging people that have no interest in firearms or self-defense to go out and buy a pistol and carry it around where ever it's legal - simply because it's a right.

Please note:
The name you see on the bottom red stripe in some photos is NOT in this version. This was a school project and we put the child's hand written name on his project but I removed the name for this version. 

We used a hot glue gun to assemble the flag, but any glue should work fine. 

Print each file in the appropriate colors. There are the red stripes .stl, the white stripes .stl, the blue star pannel .stl, and the base stand which all the pieces fit into.

There are also 2 files for extra stripes in case you lose or break on by accident. There is a spare short strip and a spare long stripe. 

This design utilizes all 218mm of a 220mm Ender 3 bed, so the base will need to printed without a skirt. 

The stars and stripes are fairly quick prints but the base takes a while. So if you're in a rush you can do without the base stand and glue the stars and stripes to another piece of media such as wood or cardboard. But you will need the white background for the stars.The photos should make this project self explanatory. Hope you enjoy!

The objects are designed to print in place without any supports.   Once printed, if your printer is reasonably well tuned, there are three rotating parts within the base.  One for the main symbol and the other two are for the small Yin Yang circles.

To print the base, you have to ensure it is placed flat on the bed and when printer, you have to give a few firm push to detach any strings or stuff left over and the parts should be able to rotate.

The spacing between movable parts are 0.6mm so this is should work for most printers.  I had an earlier 0.4mm version that also worked but required a bit of a knock from a hammer which I didn't want,.

Choose a color for the base that will make the two colors stand out.  I used MG Chemicals Copper colored PLA because I knew I was going to use red and glow-in-dark white.

Then you have to print the yin yang flow and the inner circle twice, in your two favorite contrasting colors.   Normally taichi diagrams are black and white, I chose eSun fire engine red and some CCTREE glow-in-dark blue filament that looks white normally (yes this will rapidly wear down bronze nozzles, but I replace a nozzle every 2 months).

The emphasis again is on printing onto a flat mirror with no glue --- this gives the best smooth surface for FDM that surpass even SLA resin printing.

I printed all in 0.3mm to save time, but the base would look better in 0.2mm.   

There is also 1 5mm hex plug that you can use to cover the hole in the base if you choose to hang this on a wall.   This hex plug trim can be removed with a small flat head screwdriver.",,"['coaster', 'drink_coaster', 'medallion', 'taichi', 'taichitu', 'toy', 'wall_art', 'yinyang']",6,190,17,0,0,0,Art,signs-and-logos,

But what does that year look like in television show binges? I'm uploading my header signs, the PLA jumprings I used to connect them all and all the shows I binged. I'm also going to be uploading a blank panel (this file) so you can fill in your own shows and have them coordinate with any panels you pull from me.

All of these were printed on my FlashForge Adventurer 3 - a single extruder machine. They were all done in multiple colors by layers by inserting pauses in my .gx code and changing colors. I'll leave the pause points in my notes with each file. These points will be correct if you leave the signs the same size as I upload them - with an overall height of 6mm, unless otherwise noted.

I used command strips to hang these as they're quite light weight. There are no connecting rings on the top panel because I wanted it to sit flush against the second panel. The second panel has rings for the first show you want to attach.

There's a file for 3D printed jumprings that have an angular slit to open the rings. Sometimes, depending on the accuracy of the printer, I had use my side cutters to open the rings, but they worked great after that. The same remains true of PLA jumprings as metal ones - twist apart, don't pull apart - so that when the jumpring is facing you, the two ends move on the y axis, not the x axis.

Use supports on these panels to keep the connecting rings on the panels from getting really messy.

It's fast, clean, and effective.

This is a collection of 94 letters, numbers, and symbols extruded with a high-arc quality, ready to print. I have chosen this font because it is print-suitable and sign-readable. It is based on a font by 538Fonts from https://www.fontspace.com/halloween-time-font-f24944 which itself is licensed as Freeware. It has a slight Halloween vibe as the name alludes, but isn't limited to that use.

Letters can be scaled to modify overall dimensions, aspect ratio or depth in your slicer (limited only by the size of your print bed). In my tests, 3 layers at 0.32mm provides a ""flat"" letter that won't deform and can be glued to a variety of backgrounds using E6000 or UHU type glues. If you aren't good at hand kerning, do go grab the font to see how the font expects it to look. This is also where you will go to preview the shapes of letters, numbers and symbols that I didn't include in the sample image.

Remember to flip/mirror the lettering if your visible surface is to be your print surface. I expect this would be the norm except for some metallic silk filaments where the top can look better. If you aren't finishing them with spray-paint etc., experiment and take care to slice top/bottom surfaces with appropriate patterns (again, more important with metallic filaments). For a 3 layer 'flat' letter, try using 30 perimeters and no top/bottom fill, also experiment with just some pretty infills and no top/bottom layers on deeper lettering.

If you are printing letters that stretch the limit of your bed, be sure to find the largest/widest letter first, scale to fit, then print the others at the same scale.

For creating stencil positives (for airbrushing, or aerosol bleach onto denim etc.) then just two layers at 0.32mm will probably be stiff enough.",,"['craft', 'font', 'letters', 'movie', 'sign']",94,1172,10,0,0,0,Art,signs-and-logos,

This prints as 10 parts that assemble together to make the logo with the inner ring slightly recessed.

Printing:
The outside ring and X are printed in white.
The inner circle can be printed in yellow or orange, or in white and painted.
The base is printed in black.

Assembly:
Stretch the outside ring around the base.  It will fit and won't require glue. If it's too tight, flip it over so the base printed side goes up. If it's still a problem, it might require a little sanding on the inside of the ring.

Next, slide the pointy bit of the streak on the X along the path.  May require a little force to get it in. It's supposed to be a tight fit. Add a little superglue to the base and glue it into place.

The diagonals of the X may be attached to the swoop depending on your printer calibration.  If not, glue them into place.

The inner circle - start with the 2 pieces on either side of the swoop and glue them into place with superglue.  Space out the remaining 3 pieces evenly and glue into place.

It is remixed from https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5235885

I liked the design of the original by Tokliii, especially how it would be easy to utilize two colors with a filament switch.  However, I wanted it to say ""Next Tee' on both sides.   But to have it say it on both sides and maintain the easy two color swap, it needs to be in half.  So, I used Tinkercad to split it in half, mirror it, and substitute the lettering.  After much trial and error, I also decided that I liked it in all caps better, as the little circles in the small e's seemed problematic for durability.  

I used CA to glue the two sides back together, although I suspect they would work just fine without being glued...

I will make the Tinkercad drawings public to make it easy for anyone else to replace the lettering with lettering of their choice, or otherwise modify it...

This is a 3D ambigram of letter blocks where the blocks look like a different sequence of letters depending on whether or not they are viewed from the left or the right.

Included is an STL mesh containing all the parts, and a multi-part object with separate meshes for the letter blocks, the base, and the hearts on the base that could be used for printing with a multi-nozzle printer. 


###Dual Letter Blocks Illusion Customizer
This model was generated with my Dual Letter Blocks Illusion Customizer (the letter blocks were then scaled to 80% in the Z dimension). If you like this model but want to change something then try creating your own with the customizer. You could create a similar model personalized with the name of your loved one on the base instead of all the hearts, for example. Or you could create a completely different model with your name on one side and the name of your loved one on the other side.

Selva3d works great for this!

I used a website called selva3d where you can bring a picture from anywhere and make it into a 3D model I suggest not using photographs of landscapes or such as there’s so much it comes out as a blob you can then download the model and insert it to any editor you like I use tinker card from there you can bring it to any printing software you have and print a Little bit of playing with the models and you can get success like I had with this model if you have any other questions feel free to askWhat process did you use?
I know there are a few different ways to do it.
Good job!"

I'm sharing it mostly for its design process in case other people want to create their own conference badges.

The badges were made by the Polytech'Lille [Fabricarium](http://fabricarium.polytech-lille.fr/).

Compared to [previous year badges](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2968762), the following changes were made:

* New logo
* Poplar plywood instead of MDF
* Two more fields: affiliation/twitter/nickname and serial (to sort easily badges based on entrance ticket serials)
* Replace raster etching by vector etching (faster)
* Two holes for two-end lanyards (to avoid badges to turn over)
* Tokens directly attached to the badge (previous year people tend to lose the 3D-printed [token](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2988836))
* Outer cut in green so badges are detached last (avoid spurious moves during inner holes cutting)
* Optional language flag (most attendees are French-speaking and we'd like them to have the courtesy to switch to English in presence of non-French-speaking people)
* Common template text, much easier to work with, no more manual step after tile cloning

For cutting robust pattie dough for dipping in chocolate, the top bar of the T needs to be a good bit thicker, and no V cutout.  (I figure I'll keep the other one up, since it's a better place to start for modifying it to be a cutter for cookies that has more detail.)

ProTips: Peppermint patties are easy to make! When you cut the dough, pull away the negative parts, then freeze.  Dip quickly as the chocolate freezes to the dipping fork.  

Definitely look into tempering proper dipping chocolate (read the label for => 31% cocoa butter).  This makes for a harder, shinier shell that snaps when you bite into it.  It also doesn't melt as easily in your hand.

Getting your own code:
If you want to use your own code, there are a few steps to achieve this.

Download your Snapcode SVG from Snapchat
Go into your favorite design program and pull the SVG into a model.
Export to a .STL file
Slice with your printer settings.
Add pause code to switch filament color.
Those are all the steps and you can produce your own code.

I created a QR code , linked to my Thingiverse profile. Here i explain you how to do yours. Can done with any web link

HOW TO CREATE MINE ?

You have to use this site to create your QR code in a .scad file easily:
http://navlab.fr/projets/things/qrcode/

No need to change any setting. Submit then it will download a zip file.

Open the qrcodeblack.scad file (in Opencad for example) , compile and export it in a .stl file.

Then open it in Tinkercad (or any 3D program) , create a cube of 80x80x3 , import your qrcodeblack stl file , and center it on your cube.

For QR code working , you absolutely need to have contrast. So you will need 2 colors. I used white and bronze. 

Search for the layer between your cube and QR code, increment pause for swapping filament.

NB: sorry for my screwed english, it's been a long time I didn't used it

Attach to any surface, sign, person, or other everyday object that may be in need of this sign using double sided tape (If you are wanting a more permanent fix and aren't worried about damage or the endless ire of family members, try CA glue)

The lettering and brackets are extruded from the base at different heights so that you can do color changes at certain layers to get a nice three-toned effect (no additional shrubberies required).

For example, if you want to match a standard wikipedia color scheme, you print with a white base up (0-2mm), blue lettering (2.01mm-3.00mm), and black square end brackets (3.01mm-3.5mm). If you want to print in other colors be my guest (don't let me stifle your creativity!)

Now, go forth and print this tiny gem in large quantities and identify all the things that don't cite their sources for all to see! Or if that doesn't strike your fancy, try printing a very small quantity in very very, very large size and affix it to the building, monument, or public speaker of your choice.

The 1976 American Revolution Bicentennial symbol was the logo for America’s 200th birthday party and a precursor to the NASA ""Worm"" logo that Bruce Blackburn would design in 1974.

Blackburn, speaking of his work says, ""My deliberations led to the following conclusions: to begin with, of all the revolutionary “American” symbols I considered as possible elements in a solution, the only one that passed the historical reference test and, at the same time, could be utilized in a contemporary or “modern” way was the five-pointed star from the Betsy Ross flag. But the star is an aggressive and militaristic form, and the event needed something friendlier, more accessible. Why not wrap the star in stripes of red, white and blue “bunting”, rounding the sharp edges of the star and producing a second star surrounding the original? The two stars also refer to the two American centuries being celebrated. [...] When the program reached the Oval Office for final approval, President Nixon and his men decided that the proposed graphics did not seem “governmental” enough and mandated that the typographic/verbal information be arranged in a circle surrounding the symbol. And so it was.""

This is a collection of 95 letters, numbers, and symbols extruded with a high-arc quality, ready to print. I have chosen this font because it is print-suitable and sign-readable. It is based on a font by Roger White from https://www.fontspace.com/libra-font-f5854 which itself is licensed as Freeware. It has Celtic vibe.

Letters can be scaled to modify overall dimensions, aspect ratio or depth in your slicer (limited only by the size of your print bed). In my tests, 3 layers at 0.32mm provides a ""flat"" letter that won't deform and can be glued to a variety of backgrounds using E6000 or UHU type glues. If you aren't good at hand kerning, do go grab the font to see how the font expects it to look. This is also where you will go to preview the shapes of letters, numbers and symbols that I didn't include in the sample image.

Remember to flip/mirror the lettering if your visible surface is to be your print surface. I expect this would be the norm except for some metallic silk filaments where the top can look better. If you aren't finishing them with spray-paint etc., experiment and take care to slice top/bottom surfaces with appropriate patterns (again, more important with metallic filaments). For a 3 layer 'flat' letter, try using 30 perimeters and no top/bottom fill, also experiment with just some pretty infills and no top/bottom layers on deeper lettering.

If you are printing letters that stretch the limit of your bed, be sure to find the largest/widest letter first, scale to fit, then print the others at the same scale.

For creating stencil positives (for airbrushing, or aerosol bleach onto denim etc.) then just two layers at 0.32mm will probably be stiff enough.",,"['craft', 'font', 'letters', 'movie', 'sign']",82,1106,14,0,0,0,Art,signs-and-logos,

The bottoms of these buttons have varied from open to accept expoxied bar pins, push pins, clip pins, spring pins and magnet attachments. The files uploaded are the final design interation for securely epoxing bar pins to 3D printed buttons using a tab and epoxy to contain the pin. Put small dab of epoxy just below the tab, push bar pin onto dab and slide pin under the tab. Pin is locked, centered, and secure.

And...

I test, optomize and tune small batches of 4 color buttons then run sets of 25 or so on Prusa Mk3s MMU2s to minimize purge blocks waste.

It came with paper labels for the upper buttons, but for my needs I was missing two labels. And the lower six buttons have no labels. I thought I'd use my Silhouette to solve the problem.

Using Silhouette Studio (I use Business edition, see .studio3 file - will probably load in any edition) the upper buttons were super easy to make. The lower buttons were more of a challenge for me, so I used Fusion 360 to draw the labels for the lower buttons. I've included the Fusion 360 file (.f3d file). The output from Fusion 360 is all-buttons.dxf. I then convert this to all-buttons.svg which I then import into the Silhouette Studio project.

IMPORTANT NOTE: If you don't use Silhouette Studio, you can probably re-draw the upper buttons very quickly and you can probably use my all-buttons.svg or .dxf file to more quickly get a solution working in any tool such as Cricut.

The Studio project uses ""Print and Cut"". I printed onto glossy 8.5x11 sticker paper (I used https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VKV2H4). I used Krylon clear to spray several light coats to increase the lifetime of the labels. I then cut out the labels project on my Silhouette Cameo 2.

I wiped down the ShuttlePRO v2 buttons with alcohol. I carefully I removed the labels and affixed to the ShuttlePRO v2 taking care to place correctly the first time and to not touch the adhesive with my fingers.",,"['contour', 'contour_shuttlepro_v2', 'labels', 'shuttle', 'shuttlepro']",4,552,451,0,0,1,Art,signs-and-logos,"Correct.

But what does that year look like in television show binges?  I'm uploading my header signs (these files), the PLA jumprings I used to connect them all and all the shows I binged.  I'm also going to be uploading a blank panel so you can fill in your own shows and have them coordinate with any panels you pull from me.  

And let's face it... though it was a lot like watching an 18 car pile up on the highway, we all started our binging with Tiger King.

All of these were printed on my FlashForge Adventurer 3 - a single extruder machine.  They were all done in multiple colors by layers by inserting pauses in my .gx code and changing colors.  I'll leave the pause points in my notes with each file.  These points will be correct if you leave the signs the same size as I upload them - with an overall height of 6mm, unless otherwise noted.

I used command strips to hang these as they're quite light weight.  There are no connecting rings on the top panel because I wanted it to sit flush against the second panel.  The second panel has rings for the first show you want to attach.

There's a file for 3D printed jumprings that have an angular slit to open the rings.  Sometimes, depending on the accuracy of the printer, I had use my side cutters to open the rings, but they worked great after that.  The same remains true of PLA jumprings as metal ones - twist apart, don't pull apart -  so that when the jumpring is facing you,  the two ends move on the y axis, not the x axis.  

Use supports on your panels to keep the connecting rings on the panels from getting really messy.",,"['binge', 'covid-19', 'covid19', 'for_fun', 'quarantine', 'sign', 'television', 'tiger_king', 'tigerking', 'timeline', 'tv_series']",1,280,4,0,0,0,Art,signs-and-logos,
