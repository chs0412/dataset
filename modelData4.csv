Why I designed this
------

Before I was the proud owner of a 3d printer I had a hot glue gun, computer scraps, an Arduino, sheer will and determination. All the components were stuck together using the circuit boards, motor gear boxes, battery holder, and some springs. Now I can 3d print! 

- Increase my fusion 360 skills.
- Make something useful.
- Give back to the community.


Happy making! :)

– https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Tracta_Constant_Velocity_Joint.jpg
– https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant-velocity_joint#Tracta_joints

# Resistance against loads

This joint prevents torsional motion.
It is weak against tensile loads though due to it being **clip-on**.

# Self-centering & Backlash

It features self centering principles and some clip tension, 
thus (if clipping is strong and tight enough) 
this joint should have zero wobble and backlash.

# Friction and wear

This joint features plastic on plastic sliding.
Thus it is not suitable for high speed and or high load applications.

Moving it around a bit to break it in can help.

Printing it in self-lubricating plastic may be beneficial.
As long as sufficient clipping force remain preserved.

# Symmetry

Just like in a Tracta joint the two rotations in mutually orthogonal planes 
have colocated centers of rotation. => Simplifies math for kinematics.

Unlike a Tracta joint it is symmetric.
**Downsides of symmetry:**
– reduced range of motion
– undefined state of disassembly when pulling it apart as both clips are ~equal in strength
**Upsides of symmetry:**
– less part types

# Customizatios

Depending on your filament you may want to use
adjust the variables  **aglobal** and **tclipglobal**
in order to get a better stronger clipping action

You may want to change the X shaped struts to match your needs.

If there's demand I could make this into a customizer model.",,"['anti-backlash', 'experiment', 'joint', 'joints', 'openscad', 'parametric', 'self-centering', 'tracta', 'tracta_joint']",2,29,54,0,0,0,Hobby,robotics,

I wanted to use a fineliner felt pen to draw or plot things with a LEGO Spike Prime robot. While it is not hard to brick-build something to hold a pen, what I found really difficult was to get the pen tip centered on-grid. This became an issue once I tried to demonstrate to students, that a tank-steering robot spins around the point right between the wheels - I needed a way to mount a pen directly and exactly centered on a stud/technic hole.

So, here is a design that will hold a Stabilo 88 sized pen (7.8mm hexagon) centered on a stud. There are three objects:

##1. LEGO Stabilo Holder

This is two-stud high block that should be placed with 3 or 4 studs gap above plot surface. One block is sufficient to hold a pen, but the hold isn't as precise, as with the split variant.

##2. LEGO Stabilo Holder Split

This is one-stud high holder, of which you should use two, a few bricks apart (4-5 stud vertical spacing is enough). The lower holder should be placed with 3 or 4 studs gap above plot surface.

##3. LEGO Stabilo Holder Pickup

If you need a pen lifting mechanism (see videos) you need to replace the lower holder from the split arrangement with this. This will allow the pen to touch paper if the gap below the unit mounting block is 3 stud high and will lift the pen off-paper once the gap is 4 stud high. The plotting surface can vary in height by up to about 0.4 stud.",,"['holder', 'lego', 'lego_spike_prime', 'lego_technic', 'pen_holder', 'stabilo', 'technic']",3,144,194,0,0,0,Hobby,robotics,

4883513,Strandbeest,https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/f6/ac/14/00/06/large_display_IMG_4569.JPG,2021-06-11,11,21,1,"This is a slight remix of @nraynaud's Strandbeest Robot.  This one differs primarily in that it was designed to be a semi-autonomous using basic obstacle avoidance running an Arduino Mega and various sensors.

Differences from the original:
1. The connector is 20% wider in order to make room for the updated battery holder.
2. The battery holder was redesigned from scratch in Wings 3D in order to allow mounting of an Arduino Mega to the underside and a custom proto board holding the sensors to the top. It was also redesigned to house 4 x 603450 batteries (2 pairs in series to provide 7.4v).  A dovetail connection was added to the front in order to mount an IR sensor as it was too wide to pass through the connector opening.  Also pre-cut a hole in the front to mount a 9g servo.  The sonar holder screws into it for 180 deg distance detection.
3. IR mount for a Sharp GP2Y0A02YK0F (sparkfun.com).
4. Sonar holder for a HC-SR04 (generic).
5. 2 holes in the rear for dpdt switches. 1 switch controls the vin from the batteries to the arduino and the other breaks the ground to the motors.  In this way, I could still work on the code and not have it trying to crawl off the table.

Notes on the build:

1. Wow.  This was my first 3D print project and my first robotics project.  I will say this. You had better have a LOT of patience or a LOT of determination. I had the latter.
2. I'm guessing that the number of bearing this thing requires has turned a lot of people off to making it.  Yes, there's about $30.00 worth of 3x7x3mm bearings in there.  The biggest issue I'm having is getting them to both fit and not keep popping out.  In some cases I had to heat them up with the soldering iron and press them into place.
3. I decided on brass for the hardware. This created a problem as @nraynaud's design called for flat sided threaded bolts and/or rods.  Apparently these just don't exist is brass so I had to get creative.  And it seems that 25mm M3 screws don't exist either.  In the case of the cranks, I again, used the soldering iron to embed brass nuts into the gear.  This saved the 5mm difference and I was able to use a 20mm screw and thread lock.  Even then it still occasionally breaks the thread lock and I have to take it apart and reapply. 
4. The rounded brass nuts I chose were another challenge.  It would appear that M3 Brass Nylock rounded nuts don't exist.  So, using a straightened paperclip and some hot glue. I dipped the paperclip in the glue, swirled it around inside the nut and I made my own.

I tried to take the @raynaud's suggestion and get higher rpm motors. I ordered 175rpm's from sparkfun, they sent me 150's.  Even then I had issues where at 7.4 volts the motors simply didn't have the torque to go from a tile to carpeted floor.

While I did make this and it does work I can't say that I'd recommend it as a first robotics or printing project.  Reasons:

I had a hell of a time getting a decent print of the connector.  There was simply no way I could find to print it without supports.  And then, trying to cut and pry the supports off caused me to break 3 of the print attempts. I contacted @nraynaud and he informed me he sent that part out to a commercial printer.  Mine, just looks horrid and I really didn't feel like sanding it.

Getting the bearings pressed into place was a nightmare that caused misalignments in a lot of the the joints.  Even small deviations in alignment caused some of the joints to bind and not work properly or caused the bearing to pop out of their sockets after a bit of use.

Overall:
If you're an engineering student, I'd say this is a great project and you'd definitely get an appreciation for physics.  If you're looking for a robotics project that has legs and doesn't have 18 servos to control, well, this definitely fits that build. Just be prepared to do lots of tinkering to get it right.

Was it worth it?  After some $200-300 in parts plus buying the printer, I'd have to say, probably, yes.  Will I build another one?  Hell no.

Indeed the Stewart platform would be stronger, and the design is effectively a truncated version of it. I only had 1m of rod to play with but didn't want it to be shorter. Also the final design won't be simply cylindrical and I was experimenting with the best design method that I could generalise out.


Also the robot will only weigh about 1kg (but be 4-5ft tall!) so as long as I can reliably make the parts this strong I won't have a problem. 
I like what you've done here. The amount of weight you have on there is pretty amazing!


I'd like to offer a suggestion though. It seems to me that your design would not be as strong for twisting or forces perpendicular to the rods. For example, with all that weight on it, if you had pushed the weights to the side, the rods might snap.


I'd suggest giving this kind of geometry a try. I don't know what the shape is called, but they are used in what's called a Stewart platform. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart_platformhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S... . I think a fixed version of one of those might work well.


Good luck with your robot!

Thanks to Daniel DAuirreAg, I am still playing with Fusion 360 and Bearings. See: [https://www.facebook.com/groups/fusion360users/permalink/3000085950021517](https://www.facebook.com/groups/fusion360users/permalink/3000085950021517/)/

With my newly learned Fusion 360 skills, I have created a simple Parametric Fusion 360 Model, that allows changing ""four values on the 3D screen"", that will create a new Bearing, that can be 3D Printed.

The Fusion 360 skill that I learned is how to display Sketches (and dimensions) on the 3D model. Note: the dimensions can be changed ""directly"" in this mode, see attached screenshot.

All that is required is to change the four primary Dimensions as shown on the left side of the screen to modify the results.

When making a larger Bearing, change the values in larger to smaller size order (OD, ID, BallSize, and then Tolerance). Make changes in the reverse order when making a smaller Bearing.

As written, this Parametric Model computes the Bearing Height to a full millimeter, although it could be overwritten by a proficient User.

I will soon publish the STL file and Fusion 360 file on [https://www.thingiverse.com/eldonb46/design](https://www.thingiverse.com/eldonb46/designs)s

Again, Thanks Daniel for the inspiration.

The critter is one example, the Vorpal design is great and I wanted to make pieces that connect to each other in different ways. So you could create different kind of movements. I focus more on the software, so there is different configurations and stored and learned movements.

The electronics part could be Raspberry Pi Zero for these parts, because the software needs Java to run. The Raspberry Pi is required also because the software needs Wifi to connect to the controller.  The new Raspberry pi 3+ has an integrated Wifi. For the size, Arduino fit should be similar. I have to check the size for that. 

The electronic part as every second segment is good idea that I have to test on. 

I have made a Raspberry Pi and 2x PCA9685 board design for Vorpal that I can release as a extension.What you've done with the Vorpal Hexapod servo hinge system is really cool! I look forward to developments.

I've often thought about using the hinge system to create a robotic snake. The main issue is finding space for all the electronics. Would probably have to go with an arduino pro mini and dispense with a separate servo controller (drive 8 servos from the mini directly), plus a smaller battery like a 9v LI-ON.  A 9V LI-ON can drive about 8 servos for 20 minutes.

I think all you'd need to make a snake would be to make a new component that is basically an empty box to fit electronics/battery/etc. If this ""carrier"" part has room for a 9v battery then it would also be plenty big enough for a pro mini (possibly even a nano), and a BEC for voltage regulation. The idea would be that every second ""segment"" of the snake would also contain part of the electronics. One for the BT module, one for the pro mini, one for the battery, one for bec and power distribution Pcb.

Anyway, very cool work!"

The rubber band fall off quite often when making a quick turn or rotating, so I made this version by using multiple (tiny) rubber bands. Due to the limitted space, I only installed 8 rubber bands for each side. It is easier to install the rubber band from sideway as show in the picture. The rubber bands also add tension to the tracks. This version works much better than the previous one.

Features:
* Assembled exclusively using #6 sheet metal screws
* Front plate oriented such that motor wires can come out more easily
* Attempts to use the encoder's bearing to support the free end of the motor
* Back encoder support is flexible in angle (but stiff in lateral translation and torsion) to accommodate alignment of motor with encoder
* Back plate has enlarged screw holes for adjustment to be coaxial with motor
* There is a feature to potentially add a finger-shield in the future (not yet designed) because there appears to be a pinch hazard between the motor body and the box

Notes:
* The intent is to attach the motor to the larger system solely through the front plate.  (Front plate would be modified to include mechanism to attach to larger system.)  The box is not intended to be structural apart from holding the encoder.
* Intended for use with ODrive https://odriverobotics.com/
* One of the design goals was to make a compact system.  This box is 2mm wider than the outer diameter of the motor, and the axial gap between encoder and motor is 5mm, so it's pretty compact compared to the minimum possible size.

Due to the problems surrounding the USB cable issue(s), and a few comments for a EKOCYCLE friendly model, this new version will hopefully be an improvement. Since several FTC teams are using the EKOCYCLE, it's been shaved down to fit the 6""x6"" print bed. Also, to help with the loose cable problem, the micro-USB opening has been narrowed for a tighter fit. A support pad, and two zip-tie retainer holes, were also added and can be used if you feel necessary.

This mounting base is designed to be compatible with the same cover as previous versions, and can be found here; http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:999616. Mounting holes are sized to self-tap using 6-32 / T-32 SHCS, 5/16 long.

============================

The Code Kitty robot is a 3D printed robot designed to help teach kids coding. It was developed by the Code Kitty non-profit because we wanted there to be a robot cheap enough for every kid to have one and learn the joy of engineering, coding, and robotics!  We offer the robot to participants of our workshop, or sell complete robot kits under a ""buy one/give one"" program for $50.  

Although the 3D printed parts of the robot are the same, there are two ""builds"" of the electronics of the robot:  The ""Workshop Build"" and the ""DIY Build"".  In either case you will need to print one base, one face, one tail, two rings, two wheels and two hubcaps.  We recommend combining all of the parts you want to be the same color into one print job, and the parts are small enough that the entire robot can be printed in two print jobs on most 3D printers.


The ""Workshop Build""
-----------------------------
This build of the Code Kitty robot is the one we use on our hands-on workshops to teach coding, computational thinking and engineering skills.  It features the 3D printed parts here, along with the following

This 3d printed walking robot uses a unusual Heel - Toe mechanical design for walking. The heels of the feet have free rolling wheels that stay in contact with the surface. The toes lift up as a foot moves forward and go down as the  foot moves back. I used a 48:1 TT type motor running on a single AA battery. I also added LED's to the Head and used a step up voltage regulator to boost the 1.5 volts.

I had built this to be a loaner bot that I could give out without having to send my more expensive transmitter with the bot for them to practice with since it includes a basic 3 channel receiver and duel stick transmitter as part of the build. Parts list and build notes are included as part of the download.

This is a N20 spinner flipper similar in design to the heavy weight bot MAMMOTH shown on the battlebots tv show.

Total cost came out to about $60 for me but could be slightly more if you lack some of the tools that I already had or possibly less if you find better deals on the parts.

NOTE: parts are not oriented in best directions for printing, works best to lay parts as flat as possible before slicing.

please feel free to reach out if you have any questions.

#Video of the arm available here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8MM58L4rsQ

This robot arm is made from four FDM printed sections, standard 9g Servos, standard petentiometers and an Arduino board (or even a raspberry Pi etc). All you need is to print the sections, glue the servo horns to the pieces, assemble the arm, configure the Arduino board, and set up your controls, whether using the control base included or your own controls. 

This is a great project for high school, A-Level, BTEC or Undergraduate study. This is my submission for my Level C undergraduate degree.

I've also decided to design my own 3d prints for the arm itself in which I will leave in the folder. 
1. Download and Unzip Folder
2. README file for a bit more info
3. Make sure when you plug your Arduino Mega to your computer that it is connected and recognize by the Arduino IDE with the correct port. (PORT 7 for me)

Honestly Hardest part is to get the circuitry correct to achieve the results.

I hope it won't take as long as what you've gone through though. Kudos for your project too!Yeah, Arduino and servos is one of the simplest ways to go, so it's usually what I recommend.

I have  not even opened the GoPiGo box yet, but it always my habit to check for updated marks and builds people have created.  Nice work.

Your design will fit nicely on my library's MakerBot 5th Gen  for printing.  My guess is I will build an unmodified GoPiGo with my nephew, and then with that under my belt will see about printing your design for my own kit.   Any updates I can think of will be post as you asked with an new ver # and an attribution to you.UPDATE: I discovered some issues which make the part unusable until I correct them.  The biggest issue is that I managed to attach the fins (for lack of a better term) which protrude from the base onto the wrong side of the base.  As you would imagine this causes all of the holes which are not already symmetrical to be in the completely wrong location.  I suppose the most economical thing to do would be to dremel the sh** out of the current print so that it works well enough to use but instead I'm going to go back to the drawing board and correct any issues as they are discovered.

I will say though that even though they are on the wrong side, the fins are aligned just about perfectly.  I may nudge some things by a millimeter or so just to make sure they are spot on, but not bad at all for a first attempt.  I also had to carve out a tiny chunk from two fins to make room for a nub which sticks out one side of the motor - I didn't even notice that was there until I tried to assemble the thing.

Anyway, I'll try to get an updated design finished over the weekend.  So, if anyone was planning to test this out you're better off waiting a few days until I've got the kinks ironed out.  Thanks everyone for your interest though - I'm amazed how many views and downloads this thing has gotten so far.I had the part printed by someone who had a Replicator 2X.  The part arrives tomorrow but I've attached photos he sent me of the printed design.  If anyone is interested in where I got this printed I would recommend checking out http://www.makexyz.com/

The same design which would have cost over $50 at shapeways cost me only $21.28.  I could have waited a couple months and printed it for free but I figured by then I'd have lost some of the parts or stuck the gopigo box in a corner and forgotten about it.  20 bucks hopefully ensures I can build this damn thing right now and hopefully without further problems.

I then used an Arduino to drive the servo motor, so it could break the build adhesion forces and move itself off the build plate. This is a test piece for a larger project I am designing.

","Materials:   
This servo motor: https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9347  
An Arduino  

Place a small piece of blue tape on the top of the servo so that the filament can stick to it easily.   

When the printer starts to print the flat overhang, pause the print and place the servo motor in its place, with the smaller 180 degree servo horn attached and rotated such that its touching the ground when the servo is laid down horizontally (as it would be in the part).  

Continue the print, and watch the printer lay filament down on the surface of the servo motor.  

Once the print is done, plug the Arduino in and run Arduino's ""Sweep"" example code, but change the delay to 700 ms. This will get the motor to pry itself off of the build plate!

This is an ongoing project.  Currently the robot is unable to operate without the assistance of a cord suspending it up off the ground.  This is due to the legs motors not have sufficient power to stand the robot up (possible solutions), but moreso because the gearing of the JX-60 servos and other similar form factor servos has some play in it when locked into a position.  This play makes the robot posture floppy and cannot pose in a rigid position.

Another option is to pause your print job after 2 mm worth of layer height and switch to a contrasting color plastic. We did this in the photograph shown above. We printed that at 0.3mm layer height initially using yellow ABS. We paused the job right near the start of layer 8 (2.4mm total height), switching to purple ABS.

Small suction cups can be purchased from craft and hobby stores or Amazon.com. Make sure you read reviews to find suction cups that actually work!  We used a 3/4"" diameter cup from Amazon and it works great on glass or fridge surface.

If desired, make it into a fridge magnet or white board magnet by attaching a peel-off 2"" diameter magnet sheet (other diameters, or even square magnet sheets, will of course also work).  These are available from craft stores and Amazon.com.

Please note - this is not a plug and play wheel...it was modified for a particular variant. 

However, it can be easily modified to generate a new STL that fits your situation, needs or problems.

This is an openscad file for generating custom wheels for SMARS. It was specifically designed for the stepper variant of SMARS found here - https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3202688/

Which is a modification of the original SMARS found here - https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2662828 designed by Kevin Thomas.

In order to use these wheels on a regular SMARS you may need to tweak parameters...but that is the point of parametric openscad files right!

Most problems people have with the original SMARS track tension and wheel wobble can be resolved by tweaking this file to generate slightly modified wheel.

Servo Controlled Robotic Gripper using rack & pinion drive for parallel jaw movement

https://youtu.be/Qfd0ikdnAsg

This is a robotic gripper/jaw that uses a low cost Tower Pro MG996R servo.

As opposed to some grippers that use a lever action, this directly drives both jaws with a rack and pinion action.

It therefore has slightly more grip that traditional lever grippers and the jaw movement is totally parallel.

It could be easily modified to fit on to a robotic arm.

It requires:
- Servo Motor (1 pcs): https://www.banggood.com/custlink/GG3vPi6OIB
- Screws and nuts: https://www.banggood.com/custlink/G3mvFi0OaC
 · M3x16mm Screws (4 pcs)

Use 1/4 inch threaded rods for the REV1 version, the others can be mounted with various other types of screws.  I printed mine in PLA, so you may experience some ABS shrinkage, but with some trial and error you should be able to scale it to compensate for that.  If you do print in ABS and find the right scale to print at to fight the ABS shrinkage, please comment the scale so I can update the instructions.  Lay the part however it will print best for YOUR printer, try letting the side with the most surface area be the side that is laying flat.

SACC Robot Arm, Make 2:  https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5318858
Input Arm, Make 2: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5318293

With 9 inch arms this robot has a horizontal reach of 21.8 inches and a vertical reach of 26.8 inches. This outstanding reach is enabled by a low-cost GT2-6mm belt system.
With readily available 25 kg-cm (348 oz-in) rated servo motors it can manipulate 10 oz (¼ kg) objects.  The reach assumes a 140 degree servo range even though many are rated for 180 degrees.
The total time for the printed parts is around 38 hours using a 0.2 mm layer thickness and will use around 0.45 kg of filament.  
The cost of the arm, not including a control system or the servos is around $40. 
The servos, if you get the recommended ones, will cost between $100 to $200.
The FTC control system includes two android phones, electronics modules and gamepad, and will cost around $400 (teams typically get grants and discounts so this number will vary).

Original parts for the rest of the robot arm can be found at https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1015238

Here with all the key issues and materials concerning an anthropomorphic robot assembly would be published, including the main control program. Two versions of cladding, male and female, are planned within this framework. A robot frame is made of standard laser cut profiles, corners and plates. The cladding and mechanics elements are made on 3D printers.
There will be two mechanics available: one with simple analog servos at a lower cost, and the other one with digital servos at a higher cost.
This section is dedicated to the robot forearm designed with digital servos. The device requires:
•	2 bearings 52x40x7 (W 61808)
•	3 servos Feetech SM40BL
•	1 servo Feetech SCS40 
These can be bought from the manufacturer at https://www.feetechrc.com/ or ordered at the website http://www.AliExpress-shop.com. Either a mechanical grip or a printed arm from the archive file could be used as a robotic arm.

and
https://www.botkits.com/products/candy-wasp-claw?variant=31657300000870

For this you use the hardware that works best for you. I am using M5 bolts to attach the connector to the chassis. To attach the wedge mount, find the screws that work best for your build, and there is enough room (in my build at least, for a nylock nut to hold them down). 

Update: Version 2 is now available. Download the 3mf files. 
The electronics are essentially the same 

Hardware 
12 M3 screws
4 M3 Nuts
4 Threaded Nylon/Aluminium Spacers for M3 screws
 

NOTE: I have simplified the build and use tension as motor mounts as oppose to the bearing blocks below. 

Enjoy. :-) 

Summary
This is my first CAD designed bot. It is designed for the 1 lb plastic ant division and still very much a work in progress.

Update: It seems like the smaller wedge works better than the larger one.

1 13/16 x 4 inch Toggle Bolt - To attach the wedge to the chassis
1 10/24 Lock Nut

Additional Notes: To make weight, I had to use a rotary tool to cut down the toggle bolt and the motor shafts, and keep the wiring inside the chassis to a minimum.

I drilled a hole in the top of one of the lids to have easy access to the switch.

The angled sides of the wedge will need some kind of solvent reinforcement (even though the bot it made of PLA+ I tend to use ABS Cement).

I think that is everything.

====================================================================

<b>Printed Parts needed:</b>

2x RGS Adapter 20.95 mm (or RGS Adapter 21.05 mm)

2x Gripper Mid 36mm

====================================================================

<b>Hardware Needed:</b>

2x M3x8 Bolts https://www.amazon.com/BoNaYuanDa-120pcs-Socket-Screws-M3x10mm/dp/B01MQJPAP0/

2x M3 nuts https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NBIH92/

Some [3ALink Sound Dampening Mat](http://www.xoxide.com/sounabmat.html)

====================================================================

<b>Info on Installing:</b>

1. Feed the M3x8 blots through the hole on the concave side of the Gripper Mid 36mm and push the bolt head into the part until it is flush with he concave side of the part, see picture above.

2. Feed the M3x8 bolt with the Gripper Mid 36mm on it through the hole on the RGS Adapter 20.95 mm (or RGS Adapter 21.05 mm) so that the large flat parts of each part are against each other and the end of the M3x8 bolt is in the concave section of the RGS Adapter 20.95 mm (or RGS Adapter 21.05 mm), see picture above.

3. Install a M3 nuts onto the end of the M3x8 bolt, see picture above. Use the nut to lock the position of the grippers.

4. Install foam to the concave side of the Gripper Mid 36mm as needed. 

5. This completed part replace the Fingertip Front Plastic Plate and the two Fingertip Side Plastic Plate in the assembly instructions of the Robotgeek Gripper, Step 15 to 17.

====================================================================

<b>Info on the Design:</b>

This design is my attempt to take the [OWI Penny Gripper](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2069843) to the Robotgeek Snapper Arm with the [Robotgeek Gripper](http://www.trossenrobotics.com/robotgeek-gripper). The design required making the Gripper Mid taller to get past the larger frame of the Robotgeek Gripper. This design does offer an advantage over the OWI design: the grippers can be locked to any angle for operation. 

The reason there are two variants of the RGS adapter is I did the design these parts without access to the fully assembled griper. It has been tested by my friend with the bot but I only had the Fingertip Front Plastic Plate and the two Fingertip Side Plastic Plate to work off of. So I have included both in case for some reason your printer is not creating a perfect 1 to 1 recreation of the main part. I would recommend printing the RGS Adapter 20.95 mm before the 21.05 mm version.

A ring is one of seventy-two (72) small Scoring Objects. Rings have a maximal outer diameter of 4.125” (104.8mm) and a minimal inner diameter of 2” (50.8mm). Please note that this is not my design. I simply extracted it from the field CAD file and exported it as an STL file. The halved STL file was modified from the original by myself in SolidWorks.

I recommend using the halved STL model for FDM printing as it can be printed without support and then you can simply super-glue two pieces together to create one full ring. Additionally, if you would like to print out a full ring on an SLA or SLS printer, then the full model is available.

I recommend printing the halved section face down so that no support material is required (you will need to print two). If you have an SLA printer, it would certainly be beneficial to print the entire solid model vertically. 

Bed adhesion is dependent on several factors such as what material you print with and if you have a heated bed or not. I print with PLA on a heated bed (60C) and I use a white glue stick to aid in bed adhesion. If printing with ABS, I suggest printing on a raft as the surface area of the halved section is rather large and warping could occur. I hope this helps. Comment has been deleted"

## Weapon

The weapon linked is a extremely basic version. Any thing can be designed to be used however I suggest a weapon cut out of metal. More weight you save in other areas the better material can be used for the weapon.

Definitely worth the weight change though, I use a Flysky I6 & I6x, amazing brand and cheapest on the marketThanks for checking out my design. I have never heard of the Malenki Nano. Looks like it is FRSky only my remote is a spektrum. Do you happen to know of a similar combo esc/receiver that is DMS2/DSMX compatible?2 Things that would save you more weight towards your bot is using zip ties instead of motor mounts, that small weight adds up. Also, use a Malenki Nano, it weighs around 4 grams and is a receiver and dual motor controller in one so that saves you around 16 grams."

Automatic alarm clock turret for those who are no longer helped by a regular alarm clock.
If you don't turn it off in the allotted time, then it will douse you with cool water.
The turret is built on NodeMCU, so it can be controlled via wifi from a phone or computer, right from the browser.
The turret is equipped with an auto-guidance system based on a pyroelectric motion sensor.
However, you can use a more advanced version of auto guidance: by camera, using OpenCV, if you have a raspberry pi available.

UPDATE:  V2.0 - 10-7-17
- fixed part 2 tolerating on the pi mounting points 
- fixed alignment of part 2 with the pi I/O ports  
- fixed plastic thickness on part 2 for the attachment of part 3

Raspberry pi 3 and vex robotics match controller mount to attach to the back of the vex field monitor stand or standard 100 x 100 mm vesa screen mount.

Part 1 and 2 are the components that make up the case 

Part 3 (optional) is just a field identification tag that could be customized per event, a few options are provided.

REQUIRED HARDWARE:
- 4x 8-32 x 7/8"" socket head cap screws (attach case top and bottom shells)
- 2x 8-32 x 1/4"" optional mounting hardware for part 3
- 4x 4-48 x 1/4"" socket head cap screws (attach pi to case)
- 4x M4 x 0.7 x 8 mm socket head cap screws (attachment to vesa mount or field monitor bracket)

Standard 8-32"" VEX screws can be used to assemble the case.

I believe a M4 socket head cap screw could replace the 8-32 machine screws, however I have not personally tried that.

ASSEMBLY:
- part 2 should have 4 clearance holes for 8-32 screws 
- part 1 should have 4 interference fit holes for 8-32 screws to thread in 

- the 8-32"" x 7/8"" screws should slide though part 2 and through the vex match controller and thread into part 1 joining the top and bottom half's of the case together (see pictures)

1. Using a 3M screw 
2. Using a wooden pin (from a BBQ wooden pool)

Assembly notes:
1. The base arms connect together around the top of the injection piston. 
2. It is best to tie them using metal wire and glue them into place in 90 deg from each other on the piston top.
3. Connect the extension arms to the base arms using an M3 screw.
4. Connect the poles to the extension arms 
5. Place the ring around the injector cylinder (don't glue it yet)
6. Connect the other side of the poles to the 4 ring handles using M3 screws
7. Adjust the movement to correct open and close movement by moving the ring up and down. Make sure that the claw doesn't freeze in over expansion (open) movement. 
8. Once the ring is adjusted glue it to the injector cylinder
9. Connect the pipeline to one injector and fill it with water
10. Connect it to the claw injector and make sure there is no air caute in this closed system of two injectors and pipeline

Shuk y Kingman (nuestros robots educativos de imágenes adjuntas) tienen ruedas locas  que se pueden imprimir o cortar a láser uno de los 3 casos.

[3D print] 00128
[3D print] 00127
[BUY] GoPro HERO4 Session lens replacement kit

[BUY] 4x 2x5 self-tapping screws
[BUY] Silicone sealant
[BUY] Rubber bushing that fits 12,5 mm dia. holes for camera cables (best all rubber, but can use: http://www.tme.eu/pl/details/ag-12gy1/dlawnice/kss-wiring/)
[BUY] Plastidip

Fits: https://shop.turtlerover.com/products/fisheye-usb-single-board-camera

To make sure the 3D printed parts are watertight (most prints aren't), spray them with Plastidip before assembly.
GoPro replacement kit comes already with screws, but as they are not supposed to be used in plastics, we need to replace them with self tapping 1.4x4. Remember to fit rubber o-ring between the lens and 00127.
Fit rubber bushing inside the large hole in 00128 and push camera cables through the bushing. Cut the camera board outer sides to fit the case . Assemble the camera to 00128 using 2x5 screws.
The upper and lower case are connected together using 4x 2,2x9,5 tap screws with silicone sealant between sides.

If everything assembled right, it should fit well and remain watertight.

First mount the ball caster with the pololu provided screws. Then pop in the ball. There is an opening in the pololu ball caster part, that has to look to the rear of the robot. Then mount the piece with M3 screws and nuts to the chassis.

The tread was narrowed to better match the Colson wheels we used this year, and to clear some fastener heads on our frame.

This fit the bill fairly well.,"I printed these in PLA so they can be composted later. 

These are rather simple to install, I used 3-56 screws and nuts to attach the plate to the turtlebot, but I am mostly certain that 4-40 hardware will attach this plate to the turtlebot 2 rather well as long as you are using 4-40 ball headed cap screws.

We found the wheels we wanted at AndyMark (http://www.andymark.com/Plaction-s/103.htm), but their hub pattern is different than Tetrix. We tried to recreate a hub+gear with the same tooth dimensions used in Tetrix, but the teeth were way too small to 3d print and make strong. Our solution was to make a gear that fits the Tetrix MAX hubs (http://www.tetrixrobotics.com/Search/hubs?st=0) using a much beefier tooth, then designed a matching gear+hub for the wheels.

The Gear+PlactionHub places the gears very close to the tread which keeps things strong (less unwanted torque). We had to create the Gear+PlactionHub+Spacer when we needed extra space to wrap traction tape around the tread.

The current gear ratio is 30:60 (or 1:2). We included the design files so you can adjust the gear ratio to your liking. We created the designs in FreeCAD, but also exported as STEP so you can import into your favorite CAD program.

We printed in ABS, 0.3mm layers, 4 perimeters, 25% infill and the gears lasted the entire FTC competition season. All the extra holes act as hollow rivets binding the top to the bottom shells.",,"['andymark', 'ftc', 'ftc_robotics', 'gears', 'plaction', 'tetrix']",9,899,976,0,0,0,Hobby,robotics,

Habe 360°-Servos verwendet und am WeMos an D2 (links) und D3 (rechts) angeschlossen.

An den Felgen habe ich eine passende Verzahnung für die SG 90 Servos eingefügt. Zum Drucken der Felgen muss ""Außenwand vor Innenwand"" aktiviert sein, und mit ""Horizontalloch-Erweiterung"" oder ""Horizontale Erweiterung"" kann man die Verzahnung passend zum Servo einstellen. Wenn man bei der Verzahnung mit einem Meßschieber 4,70 mm misst, passen die Felgen sehr gut.

First of all, a big thank to OMG-3D for the great robots and the excellent building and installation instructions!

I used 360° servos and connected them to D2 (left) and D3 (right) on the WeMos.

Changed the housings to ""DAMPF"" and ""RAKETE"". The cut-out (8.5x14.3 mm) for a rocker switch and the holes for M 3 screws are enlarged on the cover.

I added a suitable toothing for the SG 90 servos on the rims. To print the rims ""outer wall before inner wall"" must be activated, and with ""horizontal hole extension"" or ""horizontal extension"" you can set the toothing to match the servo. If you measure 4.70 mm with a caliper gauge, the rims fit very well.

I attached a tractor profile to the tire and printed it with Recreus Filaflex (TPE).

Lift can be expanded to as many stages as desired. Parts labeled **1x** should be printed once for each stage, and those labeled **2x** printed twice for each stage. The ""Full Single Stage"" file combines everything needed to create a stage, so can be printed once for each stage you decide to use. I recommend starting with 3 stages, or if you have a particular height the formula for determining number of stages as a function of the displacement you'd like goes as follows (units are in mm, and round up final answer): 

(total displacement) / (shaft length - 60) + 1

There are two pulley options to choose from: bearing bore and screw bore. Bearing bore has a 10mm hole on each side for 10mm OD, 4mm ID bearings. This slightly improves resistance and tolerances, however can be used without. Screw bore has a 4mm bore for an M4 bolt, meaning plastic would be rubbing directly on the screw when rotating, which is find for most uses. Choose whichever you prefer.

This robot comes with two blades which are crap. You will never get them really sharp and they are pretty loud.

So I started to design some kind of blade holder. This one here works best for me. It uses three blades (the common ones for Automower, Gardena etc.) per disk. You need two disks for this lawn mower.

The disks fits perfekt on the motor shaft. You don't need to change anything on your mower, just unscrew the crappy blades and srew these here on.

BOM for one Tianchen mower
- 2 printed disks
- 6 sharp blades with M4 screws (like Automower)
- 6 RAMPA inserts (https://www.schraubenking.at/M4-x-8mm-Rampa-Muffe-Typ-A-Stahl-verzinkt-P003788) to mount the blades

There are two versions for blade disks. One is more high and will cut your grass lower. I used the flat one and it works pretty well.

# Print

The parts are designed to be printed without supports.  The base is printed upside down with only small bridging for the anchor tabs.

TinkerCad Model: https://www.tinkercad.com/things/hdOUMt9kuLA

# Build

1. A stepper motor is installed in the base with two M3 bolts and nuts.
2. The coupling attaches to the base stepper motor and the Laser Stepper Mount attaches to that. Both use M3 bolts and nuts.
3. The Laser Stepper motor mounts using two M3 bolts and nuts.
4. The LED Laser holder or Laser Pointer holder will mount to the top stepper. 
5. The UNL2003 stepper motor drivers will mount with small M2 screws (or M3 bolts and nuts).

Not ready for printing as I just realized the ""ring"" teeth won't clear the center spacers of the ""planets"" of the top and bottom layers. Was thinking of ditching that anyway and just running a pin through the center supported by bearings on the carrier.

An idea for a robot actuator I'm cooking up. Split-ring compound planetary gear system which uses bearings instead of gear teeth to eliminate the source of the huge inefficiency typical of these gearboxes.

Print the ring gears in assembled positions (in place) otherwise you won't be able to assemble them due to the integrated plain bearing surface. Using 0.2mm layer height, a one-layer gap should separate them and be easily de-laminated post printing using a sharp edge. The outer arm could easily be split down the middle for assembly with screws but I'm trying to minimize hardware for now.

Design notes:
I think we're going to need a planet carrier. At various stages as the ""teeth"" engage and disengage there doesn't appear to be enough points of contact to fully constrain the planets in the naive radial pattern the gears were cut. Typically floating gears are helical or herringbone where this is not a concern as the teeth are always fully engaged somewhere provided the helix angle is steep enough to span the tooth to tooth gap.
This periodic slop in the planets would otherwise introduce some nasty backlash and ka-chunk-ka-chunk, I suspect. Tweaking the profile for possible non-radial planet motion to be explored in another version (ie. walking it around the ring).

Found some examples of gears using rolling contact, notably Trochoid Cam Gears (I would've said cyclocycloid). US6902507B2 describes something quite similar to a cycloidal gearbox with rollers which we could arrive here by shrinking and duplicating the internal gear into multiple planets, incorporating a sun gear to mesh with the very same rollers.

Update (4/20/22): Some parts never arrived via AliExpress, don't think it was a scam just multiple orders from a single seller got overlooked and they only sent one. Might just order some more since it's only small change. In the mean time, thinking about friction losses of hard rollers getting bogged in soft plastic and the effect of impact stresses on bearings...

Update (8/27/22): Decided to dust this one off and sized my own dowel pins with a Dremel cutoff disk. Assembly is a bit of a challenge, a bit like a ship in a bottle. First roller is OK, but the rest need to be assembled in place within the ring gears, layer by layer. I might need to split one of the elbow pieces in two to make it easier (or even possible).",,"['compound_planetary', 'planetary_gearbox']",32,174,54,0,0,0,Hobby,robotics,

The robot is intended for undergraduate/graduate level students and was designed in such way that the students can comfortably assemble it at their own homes. 

In Thingiverse, I'm sharing assembly requirements and high-definition `.stl` project files under [CC BY-NC-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/choose/). Read the license carefully before continuing.

#### Disclaimer

The information herein is work-in-progress, but the robot has been successfully used in classes. If you are an educator, please contact me directly for more up-to-date information.

All product links in this summary are used only as reference (they are not referrals, I do not get payed for clicks or purchases made through them). This project does not endorse nor is endorsed by any specific manufacturer or vendor.

#### Requirements
To assemble the 5-DoF robot, you'll need:

##### Servo Motors
In this project we use the +-180 degrees position-control models, and **NOT** the velocity-control models. 
- `MG996R` (x4) (We use the standard disk horns that come with most models)
- `SG90` (x1)

Depending on your location you can easily find these at, for example, Amazon.

##### Screws (necessary)
- The screws that come as a set with the servos.
- M2-8 self-tapping pan head screw (x26) [Example](https://us.misumi-ec.com/vona2/detail/221000547618/?PNSearch=CSPPNSA-SUS-TP2-8)

##### Servo cable extension (recommended)
- 30cm or so (x3) [Example](https://www.amazon.com/RCmall-Servo-Extension-Cable-Futaba/dp/B01MQPCLPT)

#### What to print:
Print one of each of the available models:
- `umirobot_l1.stl`
- `umirobot_l1_cover.stl`
- `umirobot_l2.stl`	
- `umirobot_l2_cover.stl`
- `umirobot_l3.stl`
- `umirobot_l4.stl`
- `umirobot_l5.stl`

#### Print settings
- Resolution: 200
- Infil: 15
- Supports: Yes
- Tested on: QiDi Tech X-MAX, Raise3D
- Filament material: PLA
- The 3D-printed parts of this project were designed for hassle-free printing, so they should be compatible with most printers and filament brands.
- If you have a large print surface, you can print all the parts in one go (e.g. with the X-MAX).
- Some early prototypes were printed using SLA, but it is not recommended unless you use a non-brittle resin. 

#### How to assemble
- Under construction

#### Software
This design is also backed by a mature software infrastructure.
- [Arduino UMIRobot](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/umirobot/)
- [UMIRobot Python](https://pypi.org/project/umirobot/)

#### How I designed this
The UMIRobot was designed from scratch using Autodesk Inventor PRO 2021 with an Educational License.
The geometry of the robot was decided in such way that it resembles the geometry of industrial-type arms and can be easily assembled.

Requires one base and two clips.

**Assemble so the flat side of the clips is aligned with the square side of the base.** The base here is thicker than the ServoCity one, which allows the mount to lay flat against a channel at any orientation.

Default values are provided for ZTE Speed and Moto E4. For other phones, simply enter the phone width and thickness using the Customizer.

Yep... had a failure of hook... oopsy...

We will probably test both ideas. Would like to be more clip based than box. Easier to work with.Yeah, a fall from the lander counts as rough treatment.  :)

I look forward to seeing your beefy design.  Are you thinking clip based or more box based?It is a great mount, that is for sure. Our phones are behind a 1/8 Aluminum plate, but with a few hits from the sides and a fall from the lander, we were breaking the thin vertical portion of the clip that holds the side of the phone, even when using the thicker designs.While this is a decent design for phones in a protected location on the robot, it isn't a great choice for a phone that might get exposed to some rough treatment. Note that you can make the brackets thicker for a bit of added strength. My preference is the ""thickness5"" option with 5mm brackets, though you can easily make them thicker using customizer.

If you come up with your own beefed-up design, I hope we'll see it on Thingiverse!  :)No worries, thank you for your time. We were looking to beef up your design for this year. We are currently using this design, but having some failures due to rough game play testing. Probably going to have to CAD our own idea up, which shouldn’t be too hard. Thanks again! Sorry, I don't. It's designed in openscad: source files are available in ThingFiles. 

I think there are some STL-to-STEP conversion utilities available on the web that you can use if you need a STEP for whatever version you are using.Do you have a STEP file of this?could you make a case for the moto e4? First off, the design is completely customizable so you can easily make a mount for ANY phone by just measuring the phone dimensions and entering the dimensions in the Customizer. Just click ""Open in Customizer"" and go from there.

But second, lucky for you, the default thing files are actually for the Moto E4!  :)  I suggest the thickness5 clips file and the 4inches long base file for the Moto E4. You can find these files in the ""Thing Files"" section of each part, or at the following direct links: https://www.thingiverse.com/download:5208409  https://www.thingiverse.com/download:5269302

Camera neck: I created a small neck which attaches to the top plate with a couple of M3 machine screws and nyloc nuts.  It accepts the standard Antdroid camera mount.

It has a screw hole, which is compatible with the screw that comes with CHIP. There are holes for Lego Technic beams on either side of the case, Lego studs on the top, and the bottoms of Lego plates in each bottom corner. The case measures exactly 8x8 Lego studs. All side ports are exposed, but the CHIP is hidden from view in the front and back of the case, giving the case a more professional look. Ventilation for the bottom side of CHIP is achieved through the bottom row of Technic holes on either side, as well as two slits in the bottom of the case, designed to be reminiscent of similar slits on the bottom of the LEGO Mindstorms NXT Intelligent Brick. Despite a specifically designed thinner wall for it, due to the slight (~1mm) overhang of the MicroUSB port on CHIP, the CHIP must go into the case ""one end at a time."" The entire case is the height of 5 Lego plates, but due to a design limitation of the bottom of the case, the case must be placed on four 1x2 plate ""stilts"" in each corner to fit on top of an existing Lego model. Because the case does not have a top (although the user can build one with Legos if they so desire), GPIO ports are exposed in the case.

EDIT: I have designed a companion battery case for this case. It was designed to fit the battery in my PocketCHIP. It is a similar style, except it is four plates tall, has only one row of Technic pieces, and has two full rows on the bottom for Lego studs. Also, it does not have full rows of studs on the top. This allows it to snap into the bottom of the CHIP case, as well as encouraging the user to design for adequate ventilation. If the user would like to have full rails on the top, they can accomplish this using 2 1x8 Lego plates. Although this case was designed to attach to the bottom of the CHIP case, it can also go on top. (If you want the Technic holes to line up in this configuration, however, it is necessary to add 2 1x8 Lego plates between the cases.) To insert the battery into the case, first thread the wires through the slot and then fit the battery into the enclosure.

Note that the channel the belt runs in isn't quite the same shape (this one is wider), but it works well. The 3D printed one isn't as smooth as the original, giving more surface grip but less sidewall. Anyway, it works.",,"['botvac', 'lds', 'lidar', 'neato', 'neato_robotics']",1,250,496,1,0,1,Hobby,robotics,"Agreed, the cutouts are likely unnecessary. I made them initially to match the original, thinking that it needed some clearance for the screws that held the motor. Once I found a pulley that worked, I quit iterating. But I agree, they're probably not necessary at all. It's public on Tinkercad if you want to give it a try. https://www.tinkercad.com/things/3UFScssHia3I already print it without support and it's not that bad.
It would be a more convenient option and made the pulley sturdier.
I think the design could be modified to have it ""full"" style and not hollow like the original one.
BTW it's not for me, it's for my friend who have broke it after 2-3 years of, i will say, ""intensive"" use.I can't really edit or test it at the moment. Whats the reasoning for not wanting support?

The motor controller is a Double BTS7960B (http://www.ebay.com/itm/162618525315).

When the controller is mounted, access to the supply and motor wires are quite cumbersome, since the screws are facing downwards. Therefore I also created a stencil for a drill guide. Please note, I have not tried the stencil my self, but using it should create a hole similar to the one shown in the plate I used. To use it, first place the stencil (and check you have orientated it correct) and trace all the holes with a 2mm drill bit. Then remove the stencil and extend the four corner holes to 4mm, then extend the next six holes to 10mm and finally the last two holes to 25mm. Finally smoothen the edges with a file.

The Chip-E UEK was designed to add Makerbeam aluminum extrusions to the outside corners of the body. These 100mm Makerbeam extrusions replaces all the standoffs that were used to hold the body of the Chip-E together (the Arduino standoffs are still needed). The Chip-E UEK's Makerbeam extrusions offer convenient hard points mounts for other external mods and/or add-ons. Additionally, the operator now has the ability to get to any part within the Chip-E UEK by only removing 4 M3 bolts.

<b>Info on the Design:</b>

Up until the weekend of July 8th and 9th, I was not planning on entering the [Chip-E Remix Chanage](https://www.thingiverse.com/challenges/ChipEremix). But after seeing [Flying Chip-E](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2401643) and the very cool [The Zip-E Chip-E](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2399088), I thought to myself, ""These technical designs would be a lot easier if the Chip-E had the flexibility that some of [my Sci Oly](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:650956/#remixes) designs do"". 

As such I set myself the goal of making a Chip-E that had at least one aluminum extrusion built in. It turned out that having 4 would give me even more versatility in the Chip-E UEK.

I am a big fan of the use of aluminum extrusion in my designs. They offer an easy way of attaching something new to a design after the fact, and orders of magnitude easier than go through all the steps of remaking or remixing the original design files. After adding in the Makerbeam, I think the Chip-E has become more valuable to me as it could be a platform for future Science Olympiad or other Robotic competitions. I can now tack on tools, and end-effectors to the Chip-E (UEK) as needed to meet rules, to complete tasks, or just for the fun or it.  

On a side note, I left the slope on the head of the Chip-E UEK in the hopes that the robot would retain some of its character that the original Chip-E had. However, I have yet to decide if it is worth keeping or not. I may in the future Remix my Remix to remove the slope and give it a block head.

Below are the ""Should Include"" for the Chip-E Remix Challenge:

<i>Explaining your changes:</i>
As noted above, I have added Makerbeam Aluminum extrusions to the corners of the Chip-E. This offers three advantages over the original design:
1. The user can access any level of the body by removing a maximum of 4 M3 screws.
2. Creates hard point mounts for future mods and/or add-ons
3. Removes and replaces the standoffs that where used to hold the body of the CHip-E together.

I hope that the Chip-E UEK means people that are not comfortable with or don't have the ability to work on other peoples CAD files can create mods for the platform.

<i>How you remixed:</i>
After importing and converting the *.step files that Robotgeeks included with the original Chip-E uploaded into something Fusion 360 can use, I started by figuring out how much space I could take away from the inside and still have the Chip-E be big enough for its hardware. It turned out I needed to leave as much space as I could so I did not interfere with the power plug, LCD, or battery. 

As such, it was a lot easier to redesign the original body parts to hold about 1/2 of the Makerbeam and then extent the body left and right to make the Makerbeam flush with the edges of the body. 

I then added the blocky corners to the head and base to allow for them to be attached to the Makerbeam with M3 screwes. Due to the limited hardware I had on hand, I designed the through hole corners to be compatible with the M3 x 16 screws I had on hand. This required me to thicken the Top (plate) to fill in the gap left by a missing 3 mm in the overall height of the Chip-E. I added walls to the bottom part of the Top Plate to allow for the Arduino standoffs to still function as designed.

Finally I added way to may holes into the midsection to allow for the midsection to be attached to the Makerbeam. This is not me just punching holes for the fun of it, I was trying to give the user of this design the flexibility to use any bolt pattern they want. 

<i>Any new skills you have given to Chip-E:</i>
I gave Chip-E the ability to be expandable and modifiable without the person doing the changes having to completely redesign the body of the Clip-E.

http://dlacko.org/blog/2016/01/01/mr-stitson-robot-car-with-lego-platform/

I designed it such a way that (1) the battery can be replaced without removing the cover of the robot (2) it also has a bag for the LIPO alarm (3) the alarm is easy to connect to the battery.

To fulfill these requirements the mount is made from two parts attached to each other by two 3M screws, but only one of these parts is attached directly to the chassis of the robot.

To remove the battery, first disconnect the XT60 connector and the alarm, then unscrew the two screws (this can be done without removing the cover). This enables to remove the outer part of the mount, revealing the battery.

Some comments:

- Disconnecting the XT60 connector is much easier than it seems. You can just pull the cable of the battery outwards a bit to let the connector get out of its mount (it should not be very tight). When it is not under the cover any more, it is easy to disconnect.
 
- Glue the M3 nuts into their place


- It is for batteries with XT60 connector, but I believe it is easy to adapt to other kinds",,['mr_stitson'],2,412,470,0,0,0,Hobby,robotics,

To find out how far a robot has to travel, you can use an encoder disc. This has a certain number of grids (here 12 and 20) with the help of which you can determine the rotation. The more grids the more precisely you can control. With 20 grids, we have a distance of 10.4 mm per grid that the robot travels.

One of the patch antenna's mounting bolts is used as ground bolt, connecting the metal plate to the battery's negative pole. The cable of the antenna is guided through a cable guide. 
The kill switch has to be mounted with only one NC contact module as you can see in the picture.

auch ich bin dabei mir dieses Gerät zu bauen, soweit wie Sie bin ich noch nicht, aber das Gehäuse habe ich soweit fertig und die Motore sind eingebaut. Nun hab ich den Mäher in meiner Werkstatt mit Kabeln an den Motoren mit Strom versorgt und  bin damit einige Schritte hin und her gefahren. Erschreckend ist der Lärm dieses Gehäuses, bzw der Motore, auch noch ohne Messer. Vor allem die Radmotore sind zu laut. 
Jetzt hab ich mir gedacht, ich versuche die Motorgehäuse der Antriebsräder mit TPU zu drucken. 
Ich hab damit schon erfolgreich meinen Yard force  900 ECO Mäher  sehr leise bekommen, indem ich die Antriebsräder aus TPU gedruckt habe. Wie verhält sich da Ihr Mäher mit der Laustärke.?
Vielleicht können Sie mir antworten.

I hadn't thought about using something like blender for the robot CAD. I might need to look into it for rendering. I don't think Fusion has video rendering capability. Also, you are from Romania? That's cool. We know a couple of teams from there. Sorry about not getting to Worlds.Oh, sorry, (haven't slept for 24 hours because engineering notebook) but did you mean you'd like to use the battery or the mount for your CADs ? Umm, I don't want to sound like some elitist or anything like that but, like it says on my personal page, the software I use is Blender, which is poly-based so, unfortunately, no NURBS (i can import NURBS-based model such as a .STP (converting it to polys as I do) but I can't export NURBS so ... i work in .OBJ)

Quick fix first, explaination later : I usually provide my models as an editable ""Cage mesh"" to be used with SUB-D modelling in order to achieve the same effective functionality as a CAD model

for printing and non poly based software, i also provide a dense mesh which, AFAIK can be imported into and worked with in otherwise NURBS-focused software (if you want to use my models, use the high polycount ones, but if you would really need a proper CAD, use the low density ones and set your surface control points at my cage's extremities, should be pretty quick if you have some ""snap to vertex"" functionality) but there's one small caveat (because this is our first year and I'm learning Blender as I go, when i modelled that I didn't yet have a habit of using SUB-D so, we're stuck with one badly topologised, and low mesh density model) sorry ... i don't think we'll have any incentive to remodel it because our season just ended yesterday with the conclusion of the nationals (before you ask, ArchiTechs RO028, Romania: nationals (126 teams total) #31/ division (of 63) ) for links see my profile)

also, modelling cables in Blender is like really really easy (Blender is more of an artist's tool than a engineering workstation but I use it because it's FREE AND OPEN SOURCE and because unlike other companies like autodesk trying to sell you a program for each taskset, blender is completely able to cope with ANYTHING in the production pipeline, anything from modelling to photorealistic rendering to animation, physics simulation ( rigid body, cloth and fluid) to 3d camera tracking and vfx and even compositor based photo editing) that means I use the same program, with the same shortcuts to model and desin our robot, edit the team's introduction video, batch edit photos, Blender is realy a replacement for ALL Autodesk and Adobe products combined and that's why I like it so much 

it's a community working hard, to get a free program become better and better, with developers making it groundbreakingly better after each release (seriousely the upgrade from 2.79 to 2.8 is like the awesomest thing) while autodesk and adobe are just cherning out patches

I also like it because it's stable (blender, a free program) NEVER EVER crashes and NEVER EVER fails to autosave a state (haven't used many other programs, but I can't say the same thing about 3dsMax or solidworks) and Blender is also FAST , like, really really FAST, it launches in literally 0 seconds (not even kidding) and imports/exports in less than 5 seconds, moving around, the interface is very snappy and works n any potato (don't know for sure but I've heard from engineers that you need at least 16 gigs ov RAM before you can even THINK about designing in something like CATIA) versatile once you get to use it and the controls are being slowly decided upon by the community's feedback from the devs, meaning that, after countless thousands of hours of use, the community pros' settings usually get streamlined as much as physically possible and that becomes the default 
Did I mention it also runs on Linux ? Did I mention I use Linux (basically for the same reasons :))) 

I'm not saying this is a healthy thing for an engineer to use, because noone would hire a blender 3d designer, but for our FTC team (which is very small), it works more than fine and it's actually pretty good and because of the fact that you can be precise only when you need to, I'm able to churn out decent models way faster than ""properly"" modelling them in ""proper"" CAD software 

If you made it, it would be great if you would be willing to upload a .step file of it to use on robot CADs.How did you get the cord on the battery in the first picture render? Did you create that yourself, or were you able to find a CAD somewhere? I have only seen the CAD version where the wires go off into nothing."

The design is partly customizable by changing the number of tooth and width of the pulley. I have made some comments on the other parameters also, so for the mathematically inclined there should be no problem to modify the other parameters as well.

Please note that I have assumed bend-point of belt to be in the middle of the belt. If you want a tighter fit, change outerCircleDia ""-(3.8-2.06)"" to a slightly smaller number, to reduce the offset. 

To change parameters in the Fusion360 model, download it from the provided link(generated by the share-button in Fusion360 and open it in Fusion360. Then go to modify->change parameters. Here you can apply any changes you want.

Would love to have a play with it, but looks like the ability to download this via the a360 site has been disabled?I think the pitch line offset you're using in the outerCircleDia is incorrect. If you change 3.8 mm - 2.06 mm to just 1.143 mm in the outerCircleDia expression, the outerCircleDia will match the diameters in this spreadsheet https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xIQPF29JR5a9Mol_dUn4d7aZf8-05d8prlmgsJUjgko/edit?usp=sharing which I found in this tutorial https://capolight.wordpress.com/2018/06/16/full-guide-to-creating-a-htd-timing-pulley-in-cad-fusion-360/ and the 62.52 OD for 40T pulley mentioned in the post below.
Making that change, it produces pulleys that match mine done by following that tutorial but saves me time if I have to change the sizes. Thanks.Great Work - thank you

are you able to make other gear types in the same way?A lot of other sources name a tooth inner radius of 3.2 mm your model states 3.05. Pulley OD at 40 teeth is then 61.922 mm http://gear.com.my/wp-content/uploads/pdf/page54-57.pdf as per this table 62.52 mm.Hi Daniel,

Thank you for your response! I agree that is unfortunate.  I appreciate you replying back.  Would you mind shooting the file over to me via email movie21revolution@hotmail.com, I'd greatly appreciate it.

CyprianAre you sure? Alternatively, exporting the model as f360 file should make it accessible.No problem, I modified the file for myself already. I'm not totally sure if it'll work but I think you can export a fusion 360 archive to disk then upload it. Try this https://drive.google.com/file/d/1p104JJw5y76FxkLqrSCnB8Sc_4NbQLCh/view?usp=drivesdk
It's the pulley with the modified outerCircleDia and some flanges added to match a pulley I bought off AliExpress.Hi Erik,

Sorry for my late reply. My account was more or less left for dead.
Yes, you are probably correct about your statements. That said, it does work quite well as is. But now that sharing publicly is no longer an option in fusion360, i guess its irrelevant if i fix it or not :P Unless you want me to fix it and export a whole bunch of sizes :P If you figure out a way to export the model from fusion360 i can send it via email, but i cannot see the option for it.

Thank you. Though, read the comment below befoer you incorporate in design. It might be slightly off on some dimensions.
You can make anything parametric. It is not to difficult once you manage to leave the constraints behind. I advise you to go on youtube and search for ""parametric design fusion 360"". I guarantee you will find it interesting.

Best regards,

Dear TiGer815,

You might be correct. I have added my sources in the design comments and additional research turned out similar results, although it was not the easiest thing to find reliable information about. Either way I appriciate your feedback on the matter. .6mm difference is too much. I will look into it.

It is designed around the generic 1:36 gearbox found in many cheap drills of various brands (for example Bosch PSR 960).
I´d recommend using the drill pattern as a template for making aluminium mounts for the motors due the heat created by the motors and shock loads in some applications.

Assembly:
You might have to grind off a little bit of the output shaft in order to fit the bearings onto them.
It is crucial that the ringgear interlocks with the holes in the 3d-printed housing. It will press further into those holes while tightening the screws.
The assembled gearbox should run smooth. If it doesn´t, check for misallignment, debris or such things.

Additional parts required:
-Donor drill
-12x19x5 ball bearing (2x)
-countersunk screw m5x50 and nuts (4x)

The shim pictured above is taken from the donor drill. The wheel pictured above is astandard foam wheel for 1/8th scale rc race cars and is pretty easy to mount on the 12mm part of the shaft.
So far I´ve done ~5min of test driving with these gearboxes on my half of a fw clusterbot (combat robot). Instead of the brushed 540 motors that came with the drills, I´m using an experimental brushless setup with 2212 outrunners.

Mid print, place two standard size servos into your print, with the servo horns attached, right before it starts to print the top section of the piece. Make sure the ""ends"" of the horns are tangent to the top and bottom of the servos. I designed the wheels for that orientation, to make coprocessing simple.  

The overhang in the part will now be supported by the servo motors. To get the filament to stick well, I laid down a strip of painter's tape.

This is most common in rapid horizontal flight. Conventional aircraft avoid this problem with the use of a pitot tube static pressure port. However, multirotors that can move in any of 4 axes need a solution that works in any direction. A disk-shaped static pressure port can accomplish this.

The Gill static pressure port is a type of barometer port that is designed to reduce static pressure measurement errors in high-wind conditions. It does this by decelerating the incoming air, entering at the edge, then isolating the inlet from the flow. These inlets are commonly found on weather stations.

I also made the x2 screw holes on the sides of Potentiometer hole go all the way through to the otherside--

People use all different sort/sizes of Potentiometer and modify that spot to suit their Potentiometer--- other than that everything else should be pretty easy—iv used the original parts from Mr Gael and not modified ones,,, all I’ve done is join the 2x Bicep frames together (which was a Perfect fit) to make the one part –

The Bicep Frames are the same for both sides of the Bicep -&-  for both Left and Right arm,,, so you only need the one file--  but have done both sides just in case the material you are using has a different Topside finish to the Bottom Side finish--

Note*-- I do not have a CNC/Laser Cutter and these files where done by request – there are the original STL converted to DWG – --and -Mr Gael- designed them 3d Printing not CNC/Laser Cutting so there will be problems as dictated by “Murph’s Law”

It only takes up the bottom half of the phone and leaves both the front and back cameras exposed. The thickness of the compartment for the phone is larger than the actual thickness of the phone intentionally. It is intended that you put a springy object (such as a folded index card) in that space so that the phone is not either being compressed or permitted to rattle around because of the risk of damaging the phone or the mount.

* [Thing 2513566: Vorpal The Hexapod](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2513566)

I made this entire project and all accessories open source and respectfully ask you to consider supporting the project. We successfully funded on Kickstarter with hundreds of kits sold, and now we have our own store. We've sold over 700 kits so far. We have more than just the Hexapod electronics, we have all kinds of things useful for small robotics and other projects:

+ IMPORTANT: Sign up for our newsletter for new products and notification of improvements: [Vorpal Store Newsletter List](http://eepurl.com/dcJCgr)

Why do I need this for the Hexapod?
------------------------------------------------
These are corner posts you can use to make a 4 foot by 2 foot field for Vorpal to romp around in. This field is perfect for games like Joust and Capture the Flag, or just for testing. Two to three Vorpal Hexapods can run around in this sized field comfortably.

Here's a video of the field in use during a ""Joust"" competition:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wikXps27vTA

We use this field at all of our demonstrations, Maker Faires, our internal testing area, and other activities so it is tested in real life for many hours and works very well.

PRO TIP: For transportation, the entire thing breaks down in about 1 minute and can be carried conveniently in a ""Corn Hole"" game bag.  Yes, I had no idea what the game ""Corn Hole"" was until I started searching for 4 foot by 2 foot bags!  But it turns out that bags made for this game are perfect for carrying around Vorpal Fields.  In fact you could easily put two Vorpal Fields in a typical Corn Hole Game bag, and some bags are large enough to hold several Vorpal Hexapods stored in plastic shoe boxes, batteries, and everything.

How Do I Build The Field?
-----------------------------------
What you will need:
* Four of the Corner Posts printed in your choice of plastic.
* Two strips of polycarbonate strip 1/8"" thick, 4"" wide, 2 feet long. (Available from McMaster Carr in the USA part number 	1749K619)
* Two strips of polycarbonate strip 1/8"" thick, 4"" wide, 4 feet long (Available from McMaster Carr in the USA part number 1749K619)
**Note: it may be tempting to substitute acrylic (aka plexiglass) for the polycarbonate (aka Lexan) but acrylic won't last as long, it tends to crack. Polycarb is made to be impact resistant.
* A piece of MDF plywood sheet, 1/2"" thick, 2 feet by 4 feet. Paint it on both sides (so it doesn't warp) with your choice of colors. You may substitute regular plywood but watch out for splinters.
* Duct tape.
* Optional: two 3 foot pieces of aluminum angle, roughly 1"" by 1"" legs and 1/16"" thick, but a wide variety of sizes would probably work.

Total cost for everything is right around $50.

Assembly:

Amazingly, if you can buy the parts I listed above you don't need to do any plastic or wood cutting whatsoever! The plastic strips and MDF are exactly the right size for everything to work. If you don't live in a country where McMaster Carr ships and these sized items are not available, well then you may need to do some cutting. However 3mm thick plastic should work pretty well, and you can adjust the size of the field to fit local size material availability, it doesn't have to be exactly 2 feet by 4 feet.

1. The plastic strips simply slot right into the corner pieces which then sit nicely on top of the MDF sheet. They should hold nicely without doing anything else. It's a tight fit so wobble it in. If for some reason it's loose (maybe you bought the wrong thickness plastic strips or your printer underextrudes) you can put some scotch tape on the end of the plastic to make it a bit thicker.
2. Secure the bottom of the long strips of plastic to the MDF by using strips of duct tape. Try try to be careful to only overlap the plastic strips by 1/2"" or so, leaving most of the tape on the bottom of the MDF so it won't be seen. This stops the plastic from bowing out away from the field.
3. Optional: If desired, use 3 foot long sections of aluminum angle to secure the centers of the long runs of plastic so they don't bow out. One leg of the angle will be on the bottom side of the MDF, the other end will go against the polycarbonate strip to provide a slot that keeps it pressed against the MDF. You could tape the angle to the MDF, or sometimes frankly we just let the entire thing sit on a table with no tape and it does work ok.

VARIATION:  When we're too lazy to carry the MDF to an event, sometimes we just set the walls and corners up right on a table top with no MDF base at all. It does work quite well and is much lighter to carry.

VARIATION: You could make a field of any size by just using different sizes of plastic strip. A 2 foot by 2 foot field or 2 foot by 3 foot field would be extremely easy to carry to a small demo, and would even fit nicely in a suitcase for air travel.

we used this clamp to fix and adjust some measuring bridges to thin boards. I guess you can also use it to fix other things onto industrial profiles. 

Leave the bracket away and only use the clamp, if you want to be able to tilt the connection.

The connection is quite strong and easy to adjust if you use the star handle.

The thickness of the board we used was 20mm. Please tell me if you need clamp blocks for different board sizes.

The profiles are 40x40mm item-type aluminium profiles.

Use this star handle for the M8 bolt:
https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3974809

You can cut a thread in the small holes on the sides of the bracket and use bolts (M8) to fix its position.

You can use simple and cheap M8x50 mushroom head bolts (Schlossschrauben) for the 40mm profiles.

We used PLA for the things, but I would rather use PETG if I had to print them again. Use wall count 3 at least for sufficient stability of the clamp block. No support needed (yay!)

I was fed up of it just lying there, so decided to design a display stand so that it can be put on a shelf without falling off.

The weight distribution is such that the robot centre of gravity is to the front which is why the stand is placed to the rear of the platform. It also allows the robot feet to stay completely within the footprint of the stand.

I have printed this (5 hour print on an Ender 3 Pro at 0.3mm resolution) and it does function ok. However, the top location pegs that the robot sits on are still a little loose for my liking. I started with 3.5mm diameter and ofter the test fit, increased it to 3.9mm presuming a 4mm hole. It seems that this could do with a little more.

If there is enough interest in this thing, I will put some more effort into correcting it, but I'm leaving it as it is for now.
I don't want to waste my time if it's not of use to anyone - the Darwin mini has been arund since 2014 after all, it's an old model robot and I'm not sure of the popularity.

Hi Smokin' Motors!  The rule &lt;r12&gt; ""Team designed 3-D printed parts are allowed"" could be taken to mean that you (4433) have to design the part for it to be legal, or, that as long as it's designed by an FTC team (a.k.a. not a commercial design) that it would be allowed. This would be an excellent question to bring up on the forum if it hasn't been already. I specifically made this part Creative Commons so everyone could take it and use it. It would be easily modifiable to ""make it your own."" Best of Luck to your team!&lt;/r12&gt;

I'm glad to see other people making some omnibot things! 

I thought I would share my experience with these tire treads.

After printing and replacing the 4 wheels I find the robot ""rumbles"" significantly on hard floors. On carpet, the robot is very smooth.
While not perfect, it it's certainly better than the treads that were falling off the wheels.

If I may, As a suggestion I believe the rumble could be resolved by either significantly increasing the individual treads similar to the factory, or a tread could be made that was essentially a rubber band with an outside curve, much like a bald tire. I really don't think the robot encounters enough inclines to make the treads necessary, so I am thinking a smooth rubber wheel would eliminate all ""rumble."" When time allows I might attempt to design such a wheel. Thoughts??


Btw--
It's been 15 years since my robot was last powered up. I've owned Omni since he was brand new, around 30 years! I'm glad to finally be restoring him. I fixed several electronic and wiring issues, and now (thanks again to this thing) have the drive portion working. Obviously he won't ever be original, but at this point everything now functions except the tape deck because it has a bad belt. We never used the tape deck, so I doubt I will ever repair the tape portion. Woo hoo!!!

Again, thanks! :)

Smooth tire is available for download.Hi Keith, 
Thanks for taking time to comment. I know exactly what you are talking about. I once had carpet in my living room and the tires worked out okay. But I now have laminate and it does rumble as you indicated. I will re-design a set of smooth tires, as it has been on my to do list, and make them available for download. 

I have been upgrading my omnibot electronics using the ez-robot.com controller which is perfect for bringing the bot into the 21st century. 

The omnibot is amazing and there hasn't been anything like it size wise in decades. If there's anything I can do to help just let me know. "

Here's a link from the manufacturer - http://www.nexusrobot.com/product/a-set-of-4-inch-100mm-mecanum-wheels-4-pieces-bearing-rollers-14094.html - though you can get them from many other places cheaper.

We have been using these wheels on our robots since the Velocity Vortex season and have had no issues with them.


For each wheel, you need two adapters - one for each side. There are 6 holes on the outer ring - these screw into the wheels, and then there are 4 on the inside, which are for the Actobotics pattern.

Before you put the adapter on the wheel, you have to get whatever hub, gear, or sprocket onto the wheel. There are hex holes for 6-32 Nylock nuts for using gears or chain, for a hub you can just put the heads of the screws in those hex holes.

In order to get the whole thing assembled, on one side, in 3 of the hex holes press in the Nylock Nuts that came with the wheels - The wheels come with 3 screws and nuts already in, remove those and use them for pressing in. The wheels also come with a longer set of screws, which is what you should use. In the other side, put the screws in - the heads should fully rest in the hex holes. You can tighten everything up, and its worth noting that it's hard to fully tighten the screws attaching to the wheels.

A couple things worth noting - 

1: The insert that comes in the mecanum wheel (The white thing in the middle) had a bigger side and a smaller side, you want your hub and whatever screws to go in on the bigger side, or you'll have a bunch of resistance.

2: Sometimes when using a gear or sprocket, if you've fully tightened the part onto the adapter before putting it on the wheel, it won't go on due to the screws stopping it. In this case loosen the screws until they don't protrude from the nuts and then mount the adapters onto the wheels. Then tighten the screws for your actobotics parts.

#### Inner Structure

I have printed the invisible pieces in PETG orange, with a 0.20mm resolution and 15% infill.

The 3 ""Base"" parts are printed with 3 perimeters and a honeycomb infill pattern for robustness. This worked out very well, it might not even be needed at all.

The 3 ""Power"" parts are responsible for holding tight the power bank (300g), so they must hold as well. A standard 2 perimeters + gyroid infill pattern worked fine.

The remaining ""Raspi"" and ""Servo"" parts have almost no load to carry, so the settings can certainly be relaxed here.

#### External Case

I have also used PETG (white) here because I wanted the edges of the cube to be rigid enough. I can imagine that everything in PLA would not be a problem though. It may even help for the smooth finish of certain parts.

The flat surfaces (face, panels) are printed at 0.2, with at least 15% infill (gyroid). Otherwise they appear too transparent. Maybe an additional perimeter helps?

The Front/Back/Bottom/TopFrame are printed at 0.15, with variable (adaptive) layer height turned on for optimal results. The same for the muzzle and feet.

The BackPanel and BackDoor are actually a single print-in-place. Be sure to position them correctly on the build plate of your slicer software. I have also added tiny supports for the hinges.

#### Important Notes

The snap-fits on the BackPanel are bad! They should not have been made to print along the Z-axis... You should know what you are doing when printing the BackPanel + BackFrame untouched. Better would be to rework those joints first.

The SidePanels are quite cumbersome to fit. There is room for improvement there as well.

I have marked some of the files with ""NOTmanifold"", as I could not always export perfect manifold objects from Blender.

4855061,Two Part Modular Compliant Wheel Set,https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/04/46/94/fa/89/large_display_WheelInner_Blank.png,2021-05-10,6,8,0,"Full files can be found here: https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/tool/two-part-modular-compliant-wheel-set

These wheels are designed to be as modular as possible. There are two sets of parts, the “outer” parts and the “inner” parts. The outer parts should be printed in TPU or another flexible filament (I designed these for a 90A TPU). The outer wheel diameters range from 4” to 2.5”, and there are versions for each size with and without tread. The “inner” components have a variety of different Hex and D-Shaft bores. If none of those bores work for your project you can always open up the inner blank file and modify it to your needs.

Printing:
Printing Flexible filaments can be challenging, but with the right settings it will print quite nicely. Settings will depend heavily on your printer and filament but A good general guide for printing flexibles can be found here: https://www.matterhackers.com/articles/how-to-succeed-when-printing-with-flexible-filament. I recommend higher wall thickness and greater than 35% infill. Keep in mind that if the wall thickness and infill are two low, it could potentially affect how the wheel bends. The “inner” piece should be printed out of a hard material like PLA or PETG and with 100% infill. Both pieces should be printed with high detail, so the pattern used to mate the two pieces together comes out.

Assembly:
Putting the “inner” and “outer” pieces together is really straightforward. ***Put a little soap and water on the “inner” part and gently tap it into the “outer” part with a hammer.*** If you do not use soap and water, you’re probably going to have a really bad day putting the two parts together. I recommend kind of tapping along the pattern mating the two parts together in order to ensure everything is nice and flush. Once these two parts are tapered and fit is pretty tight, so once these parts go together do not expect to be able to get them apart again.",,"['compliant', 'compliant_robot', 'compliant_wheel', 'first_frc', 'first_robotics', 'flexible', 'ftc_robotics', 'modular', 'robotics', 'shooter', 'tpu', 'vex', 'vex_robotics', 'wheel', 'wheels']",1,135,11,0,0,0,Hobby,robotics,

Printing guide:
No support except the sides. 
Rafts doesn't matter.

Assembling:
Super glue could be used wherever useful. I didn't use glue for most of the parts, except between the stepper motor shafts and the cube-motor connectors.
The cube-motor connectors might not fit into the cube or might be loose, depending on your Rubik's cube. You can either sand it down or wrap tapes around it.

Electronics:
*NEMA 17* stepper motors x5 are used in the project
I used an Arduino Uno and stepper motor drivers to control the motors. 
You could use any algorithm to solve the Rubik's cube. I would recommend the Kociemba algorithm: http://kociemba.org
You could find implementations of this algorithm easily online, in different programming languages.

These adaptors allow the universal joint included in the kit to be rigid mounted to the acrylic body panels with a keyed fit. 

I used an M3 screw to secure the adaptor to the acrylic panels. This requires drilling a hole through the acrylic to allow the screw to pass through the acrylic panel. The screw is secured on the opposite side with a nut.

The universal joint slips into the adaptors and is secured in place with M3 screws which pass through the wall of the adaptor and screw into the existing grub screw threads on the universal joint.

The head side of the adaptor has control horns for connecting a ball head end, allowing for a more secure linkage between the head and the servos, with less backlash. This allows for smoother, more controlled animation.

Includes STL files for direct slicing, as well as a STEP file if you want to remix in your CAD software.

These parts have a small contact area with the print bed, so  small so I recommend printing them with a brim (I used 5mm).

I used 100% infill with 3 perimeters, 0.1mm layer height. Print with the notched end of the adaptors facing upwards.

Cable tie is used to restraint the GNSS antenna (optional - its kind of secure already). The top frame holding the camera and the GNSS antenna is simply press fit on the top cover (without fasteners). 

POST-PROCESSING NOTE: 
Incase camera doesn't fit properly due to hole posts misalignment in the case, try using the be-burring tool on the posts. Else, simply remove 1-2 posts that is causing this misalignment. The camera will be still fixed properly. 

De-burring tool is useful to shave away edges that cause tolerance issues. A drill bit of next suitable size without drilling machine (its too fast - melts plastic) to manually spin with hand  is helpful for holes cleaning. However, handle delicately for your safety (eyes and fingers) and to avoid dimension problems due to overdoing.

Features :
Cooling vents are placed near hot components (no cooling fan required)
Cable-Tie provisions provided for further reinforcements/components
No additional fasteners required

Limitations:
The PiCam and its cable may cause interference with GNSS antenna. The solution is to cover the cable and the back of the camera cover (DONOT cover camera directly in which case may shorting and camera damage - Hint: Insulation Tape) with foil.
The camera joint is not perfect yet, the fit depends on printer and resolution.
NOT Waterproof !
Maybe a little too heavy for drone use - this is designed for rover.

Two parts - there's the hub, which is designed to fit on the hex shaft and won't rotate and the cam arm, which has a round shaft hole and slots allowing for 90 degrees of adjustment off of the hex shaft alignment.  The two are attached with a pair of M3 bolts and captive nuts on the hub.

Make the cam diameter equal to the distance between your shaft and your limit switch and the bottom (there is a distinct ""bottom"" because that's the orientation we needed) of the cam should end up square to the switch when it hits.  The hub will be a little smaller than the cam.

There are a few places for fudge factors - I printed in ABS because that's what was on the printer, but it needs a little extra room for hole sizes.  PLA probably doesn't.  These include a 5% increase in nut size over ""actual"", .5mm for the shaft size.  Play with them as needed.

The cam has a scale on the edge to mark alignment and the hub a small bump to align to.  I added that after we made ours, so I can't promise anything other than they exist.

Warning - this was a really clean bit of openscad code to begin with and got a little messy as I added cute (though probably not necessary) features, like a scale around the edges of the cam, etc.  I'll clean it up when there's time, but wanted to put it out there in case any other FRC teams could make us of it.",,"['4026', 'frc', 'limit_switch', 'shaft_cam']",2,327,195,0,0,0,Hobby,robotics,

 - the head rotation slipped off the neck gear constantly
 - the rpi had very little room
 - no ability to connect hdmi/power/audo to rpi
- no nervo board mount

Fixes/Revamped v2:
- Jaw piston is now closer in front and sits upright.
- Ear bracket system clicks in perfectly and rpi has plenty of room
- rpi cutaway for hdmi/power/audio in neck bracket.
-Rotation gear is stronger and can use a screw to hold it in place through the neck bracket
-includes upper head mount for more stability and mount for nervo board

I really like this version becuse its a tighter system leaving a bigger opening for RPI and head room. 

The next thing to design is a rpi gpio board that can be connected when rpi is inserted and turned counterclockwise from the ear and disconnected when ear is turned clockwise...to open.

I'm also using my remixed rear head design and gear (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2335838)

Hi Richard,
This is great I like your redesigns, but I was wondering what make and model of servos are you using, this will help me find compatible sizes that are available where I am.

Cheers
LindsayI see. The piston used for the jaw is narrower and for the lif of me i can't recall whom I printed this from. I believe I used to Gaels: https://inmoov.fr/inmoov-stl-3d/?bodyparts=Face-and-Jaw&parts=JawPistonV1.stl. However, I uploaded the one I used in my remix and named it JawPistonV4.stl.Hi RIchard, I made your redesign1st version and I also ran into trouble with the front neck piston hitting the jaw piston block. I am now assembling your Version 2 but I notice that you forgot to upload the newer jaw piston because this JawPistonBlockV3 is now narrower than the previous one. The version 1 piston won't fit on the narrower hole in the new piston block. Would you kindly include the narrower version 2 piston? Or another option is to redesign the JawPistonBlockV3 piston hole to the same size as the previous piston diameter? JawPistonBlockV4 perhaps? Thanks and more power to your redesigns!Sorry been busy...what slicer are you using? I use Cura and it works just fine. I will try to redo the stl when I get a chanceHi Richard,
It is impossible for me to load NeckFrameRedesignV8.stl. The load stops at 56%.
All the other files are good.
Do you know what could happen?
Thanking you for your answer.

Hi RIchard,  I made your redesign1st version and I also ran into trouble with the front neck piston hitting the jaw piston block.  I am now assembling your Version 2 but I notice that you forgot to upload the newer jaw piston because this JawPistonBlockV3 is now narrower than the previous one.  The version 1 piston won't fit on the narrower hole in the new piston block.  Would you kindly include the narrower version 2 piston?  Or another option is to redesign the JawPistonBlockV3 piston hole to the same size as the previous piston diameter?  JawPistonBlockV4 perhaps?  Thanks and more power to your redesigns!Mine does work, however the servo I'm using is not digital so its not responsive enough. But if I manually move it (using the myRobotLab servo tester, its works just fine. I will take mine out an tonight and measure it. Sorry nope it is still the same size as before :-(   May I ask how you were able to fit yours correctly?  needs to have matching pistons and blocks ... hehe :-)  Anyway I am thinking of utilizing your previous version JawPistonBlockV2 and use the matching wider pistons.  I will have to extend the block by using metal collets and using screws.  Looks like I may be able to have a workaround in case you are not able to find the correct narrower piston you used.  Hey so long as it works even if it is not pretty ... hehe.  Just to get to the next step in completing my Inmoov. 
 Thanks again for your great work.I uploaded a skinner one. Is that the one?I wouldn't have designed my own gear worm (not that skilled). However these are saved in my collection and I printed these originally:

 - https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:992918
 - https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:994720

These use the smaller piston. I've been busy and haven't been able to sit at my computer for a while; when I get a chance I will look through all my saved stl's and  see if i can find it. Hi Richard.  Unfortunately,  Gael's JawPistonV1,  Mat Monnerby's JawPistonV2 and your recently uploaded JawPistonV4 have all the same size and dimension and will not fit the JawPistonBlockV3 included in your redesign v2.   You must have gotten a narrower JawPiston from another design.  If that can't be found then the only other solution is to redesign JawPistonBlockV3 to have a bigger opening that will fit JawPistonV4 which you uploaded for this redesign.  Thanks again for your great work and I apologize for being a pain ... but I am really hell bent to finish my Inmoov Head usign your redesign.  Unfortunately as well I still don't know how to design so I am reliant on other designers.try the repaired one"

Changes:
-Added hinge to align the cards.
-Hinge auto-opens when HID Reader turns for eject.
-Stands contain holes for Arduino Nano holder and Stepper Driver
-Speedup of Slide by changing the ratio (we need more theeth :))
-Redesign Foot to keep all units in one to enable more stable design
-Added more holes to attach other things
-Redesigned the Card-Reservoir. can be stacked now if more than 50 cards are needed.

Hint: to attach the HID-Holder to the Servo, I had best success when heating up the Holder-Hole.
Then Push-fit the Holder to the servo and wait (when aligned) until it cools down. Finally attach the center screw, if the fit is tight but doesn't slip.
This can be repeated until you have good success.
It also makes sense to warm-up the SG90 holder clamps to prevent them from breaking.

The cable can be hot-melted into the guide on the bottom.
HID Reader USB cable should be Strap-tied to the HID-Holder, to allow the mechanics not block.
Make sure that the cards snuggle out, before you mount everything together.

Hint: you can mount the Stand in one of 4 directions, to allow fitting your wiring esthetics.

This one is working quite good!
Don't forget to print the weight for the last cards in the stock to slip out without sticking.

Parts needed:
-Arduino Nano (or processor of your choice and means to program it)
-28BYJ-48 Stepper Motor (you can also use other Ratio than -48. Less number gives faster eject)

For other type of movement, go to: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3091483

Printed parts:
   - 1x Rotate-A: Servo mount
   - 1x Rotate-B: Any receiving bone adapted to change as needed
   - 2x Rotate-C-2X: 2 pieces receiving axle bloc
   - 2x Rotate-D-2X: 2 pieces for the bearing and the rotate axle transmission
   - 1x Rotate-E: Axle transmission
   - 1x Rotate-F: Rotate join between axle and Servo

Non-printed parts:
   - 1x SG90 servo motor
   - 1x Bearing 8x12x3.5
   - 10x M2.5 8mm screws
   - 8x M2.5 nuts

Steps:
1- Slide the bearing onto the rotation shaft ""Rotate-E"". Use pliers as needed. It's tightening in order to fully utilize the functionality of the bearing.
2- Insert the rotation axis ""Rotate-E"" between the two parts ""Rotate-C-2X""
3- Place the 4 nuts in the spaces for this purpose in the ""Rotate-C-2X"" parts.
4- Insert the 2 ""Rotate-C-2X"" parts into the ""Rotate-B"" section, then tighten the 4 screws.
5-Put the ""Rotate-D-2X"" parts around the axis and insert the 4 nuts into the ""Rotate-D-2X"" parts
6- Slide the ""Rotate-A"" part around the ""Rotate-D-2X"" parts, then tighten the 4 screws.
7- Cut a small white piece supplied with the servo motor to insert it into the ""Rotate-F"" piece
8- Place the ""Rotate-F"" part on the ""Rotate-E"" axis. These parts are not covered together
9- Place the servo motor making sure that it is inserted in the ""Rotate-F"" part and that the ""Rotate-F"" part transmits the movement to the axis of rotation.
10- Screw the servo motor into the ""Rotate-A"" part

But the very few designs that i've been able to find do not actually have the correct dimensions so it turned out to be a waste of time and printing material. So, i decided to design my own based on the original B-Robot EVO 2 design. Personally tested! :)

You can use the same side panels from the original design, as the height of the robot stays unchanged. This modified chassis also needs the same number and type of screws and nuts, so you can re-use the other parts that you already have from the kit.

There are only 3 new parts to print for the wider chassis without requiring any other additional components: the motor plate, the electronics shelf and the top plate (optional).

UPDATE: I fixed the nut cutouts in the electronics and top plates to make them just a little bit wider so it's not too tight to put the nuts through anymore. 3D printed and tested by myself. I also attached a picture of the slightly updated electronics plate with the four nuts installed. :)",,[],3,302,442,0,0,0,Hobby,robotics,

After lots of customizations like new main board, new software (visit www.ardumower.de) and new blade disks, I found that the robot is really loud when wheels roll over stones like small paths.

The main reason for this horrible sound are the rock hard front wheels and the bad bearings of them. 

Because I had some 2K silicone laying around, I created this silicone mold to create new, soft wheels with new bearings which make really no noise. The wheels fits perfect on my Tianchen mower and might fit on others too.

1x Bottom mold
2x inner part (kern)

1. approx. 80g of 2k silicone, I ordered mine at www.trollfactory.de

A Linear actuator designed to move a glass tube up and down. It readily attaches to a stepper motor face (JAMCO-238538 used in this case). The sled moves along the wooden parts acting as railing.

* 3x Wooden sticks (~8mm diameter, 12mm height) 
* 2x Base
* 1x Lead screw
* 1x  Stabilizer
* 7x Screws (3m)
 * (Optional) rubber piece for added stability

**Tools**
* Soldering iron
* Hot glue gun

In order to open the screw holes on the base, I used a soldering iron to heat the screw and pushed into the plastic. (*This method may cause evolution harmful gases, try it at your own risk, make sure you are in a well-ventilated room and do not inhale the fumes.*). The base and the stabilizer are attached to the wooden railings via hot glue.

This size is common for FIRST Robotics, especially FRC.   While collar clamps are not a really expensive purchase, these are lighter and only cost less than $0.50 to make.  We do not use these where there is a significant stress load, but when tightened down they are nearly impossible to move.  

With two identical halves and two 1/4-20  0.5"", or #6-32 cap screws, the collar clamp is balanced to handle medium-speed rotation without inducing wobble. 

I recommend printing with a 4-5 shell thickness and at least 30% infill.

To complete the design create threads with a tap (1/4-20 or #6-32) in the smaller hole of each side.  Screw together with cap screws. The #6-32 model is designed to also include a washer.  The washer provides more surface area so that they screw does not dig into the 3D printed part. These screws can easily be found at most hardware stores.

Great bracket however when used with the Fatshark HDZero VRX for Shark Byte it’s a little short and the VRX is catching at the top of the goggles and does not sit flat.  While chances are you would be flying with the VRX angled up a little it makes it possible to damage the goggles at the top when carrying them of the module is pushed in.  

 Any chance to have a version of this this a little longer ?

It was originally designed for vertical motion in Senior Design 1 at Clemson University for a Towers of Hanoi project.  

<h1>Additional Hardware Needed</h1>
- NEMA 17 Stepper Motor [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/STEPPERONLINE-Stepper-Bipolar-Connector-compatible/dp/B00PNEQKC0/ref=sr_1_5)
- Linear Bearings - I used solid polymer bearings.  [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Printer-Solid-Polymer-LM8UU-Bearing/dp/B06XPRCMJS/ref=sr_1_10)
- GT2 timing belt and idlers - just get a set.  [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/KeeYees-Timing-Tensioner-Torsion-Printer/dp/B07JKT5BZQ/ref=sr_1_4?crid=3S4QP0TCVPNUO&keywords=gt2+timing+belt&qid=1582209565&s=industrial&sprefix=gt2+%2Cindustrial%2C160&sr=1-4)
- 4 M3 bolts, 1 M4 bolt (~25mm), 1 M4 nut
- 8mm linear rod of desired length


<h1>Assembly Instructions</h1>
As shown in the image, you print one of each file.  Connect the NEMA 17 stepper motor to the top piece using 3mm bolts, then attach a geared tooth pulley to it.  The bottom piece supports an idler attached using a 4mm bolt.  

Attach a GT2 belt to the top of the SlidingPiece using zip ties - loop the belt around the pole in the middle in a way that the pulley teeth interlock with each other, then use a few zip ties to attach it together.  Run the timing belt up and around the toothed pulley on the stepper motor, then around the idler, then attach it to the other side of the sliding piece.  

<h1>Notes and tips</h1>
I designed this to work with approximately 11"" long linear rods, but it should work with any length.  The only issues you might run into are the timing belt hitting the plastic parts or itself - you can edit the files in fusion 360 to add more offset.  
The top and bottom parts should print without supports just fine.  My sliding plate has some small offsets for our gripper, but if you don't need them then just delete them.  

<h1>Bonus files</h1>
Gripper:  Our project involved gripping rings of variable size from 2"" up to 5.5"", so we found/printed a parametric gripper.  The ""Gripper V4.zip"" file is my SCAD file modified to fit up to 5.5"" objects, while being driven by a standard cheap servo motor.

(12/2022 updated version includes a variation for the goBILDA pattern.)

Honestly, in most cases, the off-the-shelf Actobotics part# 605627 (Limit Switch Mount D) will probably work just as well if not better than this.

However, this model does not require additional fasteners (other than the 6-32 screws to mount to the pattern), and provides a modicum of protection for the electrical connections, whether you solder or use spade connectors.

Print two copies, and sandwich them together with the switch between them.

5440022,Drawer Slide Inserts for Double Strung Continuous Rigging Lifts,https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/4c/9b/b3/9f/e6/large_display_1-50_20220723_145155.jpg,2022-07-23,5,7,0,"This part was designed to provide a double pulley (v-bearing) insert for FTC robot telescoping lifts using aluminum drawer slides.  A two-pulley design provides the capability for double strung continuous rigging.

As an alternative to conventional rigging with a straight return string (and tensioning spring), double strung continuous rigging routes the return string around the pulleys for a cleaner look and reduced potential for catching the string on things.

The design is based on and intended to be compatible with the single pulley insert design provided by Long Robotics for use with their LRS 300 Aluminum Slide.

These inserts are intended to be compatible with popular 300 mm aluminum drawer slides used in FTC robots, including:
	* Misumi SAR230 (https://us.misumi-ec.com/vona2/detail/110300072130/?HissuCode=SAR230)
	* Long Robotics LRS 300 (https://longrobotics.com/product/lrs-300-aluminum-slide-300mm-black-anodized/)
	* Sugastune AR2-300 (https://www.sugatsune.com/product/aluminum-slides-3/)
	
In addition to the 3D printed parts, the drawer slides, and the string (typically UHMWPE Cord or fishing line), the following hardware is needed for each insert:
	* 2x V-Bearings (3x12x4 mm)
	* 1x M3 Screw (35 mm suggested)
	* 1x Small Head M4 Screw (10 mm) (Can use 2x with LRS 300)

The M4 screws need to be low profile to fit inside the drawer slide channel without interference.  Long Robotics sometimes has a suitable screw in stock, but I haven't been able to find another source stateside.  My source of supply has been M4x10x5.5mm screws from AliExpress seller ""SCREWHOME Store"" (cheap, but slow).

The LEDs didn't seem to help at all in getting good images of the cube stickers as I had hoped. I ended up using bright photography lighting: a fluorescent bulb reflected off a silver-lined umbrella I purchased on Amazon.  A 45 degree offset seemed best.  That worked quite well but still not perfect.  I also attached a white sticker to one of the robot grippers and used that to calculate white balance.  Much better, but still not perfect.  I found on GitHub some software that smartly assigns colors to stickers https://github.com/dwalton76/rubiks-color-resolver .  That software was extremely extremely helpful to me. Almost always perfect at mapping the cube.  Finally, just in case, I created a little local web page that allowed me to edit colors.  I actually didn't need to edit by hand from the webpage in the end since the other steps mostly took care of the problem.Thanks for posting the remix and make. I saw the white LEDs. Did they improve the fotographs of the cube? On difficult light situations the sensing is not working very reliable"

These “modeling spheres” are designed to be simple design primitives that can be easily configured for easy prototyping with servos. Rather than beginning the design process with the hardware – in this case DXW90 MicroServo – modeling spheres allow makers and designers to begin by thinking about the kind of rotational motion they want to explore in their project. These elements can be easily combined in CAD to create more complicated forms, including XYZ axis robotic arms and mechanical locomotion. They are designed to be “print and play”. The servo arms simply slide and lock into place, with no additional hardware or glue (although it is recommended to trim the servo arm as shown in the picture).

This is my prototype for a harmonic drive. Based on my tests this design has minimal backlash and is backdrivable. It's a bit big for what it does, so I'll be revising it for a more compact design. 

You'll need a 6808 bearing, two 608 bearings, some M3 and M5 nuts and bolts. Your printer also needs to be tuned well to print this accurately.

I recommend printing the splines at a slower speed to maintain precision. The supports for the circular spline can be a bit difficult to remove. I removed mine by drilling through the holes and peeling the supports out with a pair of pliers. The flex spline can be printed in PLA and not break, but it's better to print it with PETG or nylon.

Six M3 nuts are sandwiched in between the output shaft pieces for mounting to other components. The output adapter is for mounting to my other printed projects, with all have 10mm spaced M3 holes, so it's not a mandatory part of the design. You can choose to print either one of the input lids.

    Controlled by a Raspberry Pi ZeroW
    Two analog reflectence sensors
    Laser TOF distance sensor
    AVR micro for power management and analog/IR input
    Uses Python 3 for programming, and c for the driver libs.

The BOM has all the parts/pricing as well as sources. The cost when building 30 units was around $75 each.

The instructions to setup the bot from a standard Raspbian install are included in setup.txt,

If you prefer, there is an already setup image, see below.

Instructions for building the bot are in Assembly.pdf

You communicate with the Pi using ssh either over wifi or USB. The Zero will appear as an NDIS ethernet adapter when plugged into your PC. It shows up at 192.168.42.1, the account is of course pi, and the password is SumoBot.

After logging in, cd to code/test. There you will find some test code. sensors.py displays the distance and reflectance sensor values, as well as the battery voltage. motors.py can be used to test the motors, as well as for adjusting the center point pots.

To turn on the bot, press and hold the switch for a second, until the blue LED on the board comes on.

To turn the bot off, press and hold the switch for a few seconds until the blue LED starts to blink. When the LED goes off, the bot is completely powered off. The battery is blocked by a FET so you don't have to worry about leaving it plugged it.

If the blue LED starts to blink while running, that means the battery is getting low. The bot should shutdown before the battery gets too low, but you might want to turn it off at that point, just in case.

Prebuilt image
A full disk image for the bot is at: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1x3cDfR26dcHZn25fXI_K_bmpcQTh8dHZ/view?usp=sharing

You will need to go into code/AVR and do the command: make prog
That will program the AVR micro. Also, you will need to setup the WiFi to your local access point.

One other thing is that we needed the width of the wheel to be as small as possible, and also wanted to use 3/8"" Hex shaft on our robot, so we made these.

For using them, its a little bit more complex and you should only do this if you are advanced. You have to take apart the wheel, and then put it back together with the 3D printed insert. We use it on our Rover Ruckus robot, and it works very well.

It was originally designed for vertical motion in Senior Design 1 Fall 2019 at Clemson University for a Towers of Hanoi project.  

<h1>Additional Hardware Needed</h1>
- NEMA 17 Stepper Motor [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/STEPPERONLINE-Stepper-Bipolar-Connector-compatible/dp/B00PNEQKC0/ref=sr_1_5)
- Linear Bearings - I used solid polymer bearings.  [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Printer-Solid-Polymer-LM8UU-Bearing/dp/B06XPRCMJS/ref=sr_1_10)
- Lead Screw T8 + Copper Nut + Coupler+ Pillow Block Bearing Set  [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07567KZB3/)
- 4 M3 bolts, 1 M4 bolt (~25mm), 1 M4 nut
- 8mm linear rod pair of desired length (Must be shorter than the lead screw)


<h1>Assembly Instructions</h1>
As shown in the image, you print one of each file.  Connect the NEMA 17 stepper motor to the top piece using 3mm bolts, then attach the coupler to the stepper shaft.  Next, attach the two pillow block bearings to the 3D printed parts using M3 bolts and nuts.  Don't tighten them yet, they might need to move a little bit once we install the lead screw.

Install the lead screw in the coupler.  Next, spin the flange halfway up the lead screw.  Once it's about halfway up then attach the flange to your 3D printed sliding piece using M3 bolts.  Now you can put in the 8mm smooth rods on the sides, sliding them through the polymer bearings in the 3D printed parts and then into the holders of the top and bottom pieces.  Finally, install the 3D printed end piece to hold everything together.  At this point you can go through and tighten all the bolts on the pillow blocks, but make sure you can still easily spin the lead screw by hand.  If things are off by 1mm the wrong direction you don't be able to spin the lead screw.  

<h1>Notes and tips</h1>
I designed this to work with approximately 11"" long linear rods, but it should work with any length.  If you run into noise issues with the stepper motor try loosening all the bolts and nuts holding things in place, or maybe try moving the stepper motor around.  Basically it's vibration due to parts not being perfectly aligned.  
The top and bottom parts should print without supports just fine.  My sliding plate has some small offsets for our gripper, but if you don't need them then just delete them.  

<h1>Bonus files</h1>
Gripper:  Our project involved gripping rings of variable size from 2"" up to 5.5"", so we found/printed a parametric gripper.  The ""Gripper V4.zip"" file is my SCAD file modified to fit up to 5.5"" objects, while being driven by a standard cheap servo motor.

When you put both license plates (red and blue) in your robot, it's mandatory that only one color (your alliance color) is visible. There are three outer shells designs. The first one is to be mounted with two (2) stand-offs coming vertically. Ideally, it it is attached from the robot's base. The second design requires two (2) stand-offs put horizontally. It was made with the idea of attaching it from the robot's tower (where the lift starts). Lastly, the third one is designed to be attached from a corner. The sliding plate holder is compatible with all three layouts. The goal of this 3D-printed design was to use as less hardware as possible, to limit the chances of plates falling around during matches, and most importantly, to reduce the amount of things that team's have to worry about.

Too many servos to control, mainly. Then I ran into a TED Talk about the original Strandbeest. Searching Thingiverse, most appeared far too complicated, with hundreds of moving parts, or they used 100+ bearings, screws and nuts. Then I ran into your original design. From there, I found V2, and I ended my search. The video tells me this is the one I want to build.

First, only two motors, controllable just like some of the cars and tanks I've built and whose electronics I will repurpose. Second, the parts-to-print list is manageable. Third, you were kind enough to provide that great Blender file, so I can see just how things go together. Perfect.

Except for one thing: my first Linkage print, at 0.28mm layer height, broke when I attempted to flex each hinge point. So I reprinted at 0.2mm and that one came out great. The next day, I learned a lesson: on my setup, I cannot count on every hinge point breaking free properly. I printed four-up on my Aquila and promptly broke at least one hinge point on each of them. Solution? FOR ME, I modified the .stl file to have a 0.15mm hole at each hinge point (in Tinkercad) to use as a starting point to drill with a 0.19mm drill bit. Then I inserted a short length of PLA filament and heat-welded the ends to the Linkage with a soldering iron. Finally, I broke the hinges loose, and EVERY ONE works perfectly.

I recommend others tackling this build make a similar mod, as it has been proven workable, not just by me, but by MANY makers building tank tracks. I still have a LONG way to go, but when done, I'll update here and post a make, perhaps a remix, depending on what else I wind up modifying. Thanks for a great 3D printing project."

The mechanism of the feet needs to be stronger. The rods and threaded shafts of the ankle joint mechanism are a little short (I kept the lenght of the frist designs).

* I added small holes above each nut slot.  These make it easier to reposition the nuts when installing screws, and make it possible to eject the nuts altogether if you need to.
* I added a chamfer to the bottom of each nut slot.

**Project in progress, the project may be completed or reconfigured by other users.**


Open, configurable and applicable project on devices with two DC motors

The realized kit is mainly oriented to allow the displacement of a rolling base of a few kilos with the help of a mobile phone.
The motor driver is a BTS7960B DC 43 A, the movable weight then depends on the power of the geared motors.

Characteristics :

- Kit based on Arduino components to check DC motors and vary their speeds using potentiometers.

- Measurements are then used to control the motors at the desired speed using the Arduino program controlled by mobile phone, or by sensors for a robotic movement.

- The kit is on a clipping foot, so it is quick to move from one device to another.


Clip-on foot:
Support option is not necessary in the print settings but the top of the recesses tend to sag on the first layers, it may be necessary to sand the male and female feet slightly before assembly.
To dislodge the foot, lightly press the tab of the male foot at the recess of the female foot.

- REV Robotics 12VDC Slim Battery - http://www.revrobotics.com/rev-31-1302/
- REV Robotics Power Switch - http://www.revrobotics.com/rev-31-1387/
- Motorola G4 Play - https://tinyurl.com/y4mmgceb


Everything should fit without any modification. The phone can be flipped around to have the camera pointing out if need be.

Yeah, we removed the previous wings to make it smaller. We are not sure what spacing people will use, so we didn't add any mounting brackets to the narrow version. If you send us the center to center spacing you need to mount this, we can add another version for you. Otherwise, you will need to drill holes on the back and add an angle bracket to it. You can also drill holes near the front edge by the phone slot or even on the flat in the battery compartment and then bolt it to your frame that way.

As you push it into a CD, it spins an eccentric on the shaft opening or closing jaws.

It needs further work!  The return spring is not able to turn the ratchet.
Since it needs extra work, I am uploading Freecad files only (no STL).

The gripper requires 3 springs from ball-point pens and a pin made out of a paper clip.
It can be attached to a robot arm or an actuator of your choice.

Could you post an image of the final piece? Just a thought: With a multifilament-printer we could use low- and hightemp filament we could have ""bending-areas"" at the curves at stiff areas at the top/sides. Anyone with a Prusa here? :)maybe you could print some kind of ""inverted form"" /a bending-form with ""pins"" for the holes to keep them in place? Here's the two parts stacked one on top of the other believe it or not. You can see how the holes are just a little off (even a bit more than what it looks like in the picture) All in all, it did come out really good though.Thanks. :) Yeah, I'll be joining those for sure.

Want to join our Slack-Channel/Community at spotmicroai.org and spotmicroai.slack.org?Yeah it worked good (Thermo version is pictured on the left and your version is on the right).

-cutout for Explorer pHAT
-no cutout (if you decide to directly solder the motor wires to the Explorer pHAT)

I also included a remix of the https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:434600 to also be able to attach IR supported cameras. 

Since I don't have a thread gauge for imperial threads I was not able to find out which thread is used at the nuts provided with the STS-Pi, so I designed it with a M5 Thread. 
The length should be sufficient to also attach the standard power bank holder.
If you want to use a printed M5 nut: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2626023 you might have to re-cut the thread, or just use a metal M5.

This is an adapter that allows an assembly to be created which isolates the required magnet to sensor tolerances to 3d printed components, and allows the encoder to be connected to a shaft in need of encoding using surgical tubing or some other compliant means.

It was inspired by what I have read about how some FRC teams use Greyhill optical encoders.
http://www.grayhill.com/products/optical-encoders/

Besides the encoder, the adapter requires a 0.375 x 0.875 x 0.280 bearing, a 3/8"" e-clip to retain the shaft in the bearing, and two M4x8 machine screws to retain the bearing in the adapter.

Update: 1/24/2021
I just uploaded two new files the pin print in high quality and 100% infill and the new axle you can print at whatever I printed it at 5% infill at .2 quality. I am working on the mounting bracket and will upload when I have that ready. The other files don't really matter so you don't need them and the omni wheel tracker is for measurements if you need them.

Update: 1/25/2021
I have finished the mount it should be able to work on both gobilda u-channels and REV extrusions (the REV aluminum bars)

Update: 1/26/2021
I redid the mount so now it should fit nice and I've mounted it on our robot and it works well and I resized the hole so it should fit a REV screw in it better.

Update: 2/06/2021
I found when putting the mount on that my design doesn't quite work the way I wanted it to and its pretty difficult to put on, so I made some holes so you can put a 5.5mm driver in it.

Update: 3/19/2021
I forgot to mention that you can use rev short screws instead of the pin I would recommend this because it has like no play you will have to glue the bolt in but it will hold nicely.

Update: 8/26/2021
I am currently in the prosses of making a new mount that will keep the encoder on the ground for better tracking and I will put the link for it here when I'm done.

If needed you can open and edit the .FCStd file with FreeCAD.

In case you do not want to edit the diameters you can use the .stl file, import it into your favorite slicer, and eventually print the wheel with your 3D-printer of joice (tested with PrusaSlicer on a MK3S+(https://www.prusa3d.com/product/original-prusa-i3-mk3s-3d-printer-3/)).

After printing, just push the wheel over the axle and tighten the clamp with an M3 screw (DIN 912) and nut.

Erste Vermutung war, das die Mechanik ""schwingt"".
Bei näherer Untersuchung kamen nun die Motortreiber in betracht.
Also Lösung gesucht und gefunden.
Die Trinamic TMC2208 Treiber sind kompatibel mit den 4988 Pololu Treibern.
Diese interpolieren die Schritte auf 256 Steps und können nach einer kleinen Modifikation
gegen die 4988 getauscht werden.
Dazu müssen nur drei Pins am TMC gekappt werden und der Strom zum Motor eingestellt werden.
Ich habe den Strom/Spannung am Poti auf 0,6 Volt einjustiert, damit laufen die Stepper leise und ruhig.
Beim Drucken ist nun nur noch der Servo zu hören !
Außerdem ist das Druckbild deutlich verbessert, kaum noch zittern am Stift.
Auf den Bildern sind zwei Eier in gegenüberstellung zu sehen, Links mit TMC2208 und Rechts mit den alten 4988 Treibern gedruckt.
Es gibt die TMC 2208 von verschiedenen Herstellern und in diversen Varianten.
Ich habe die TMC von Bigtreetech in V 3.0 mit Poti ! genommen.
Es gibt auch eine Variante ohne Poti, die ist nicht geeignet.
Wie auf den Bildern zu sehen,werden hier die drei oben Überstehenden Pins an der Unterseite vom Treiber gekappt. 
Das war alles an Modifikation, abgesehen vom Einstellen der Spannung am Poti auf ca. 0,6 Volt.
Es muss nichts an der Software oder am Board geändert werden.

Achtung !!! bei der Montage der Treiber darauf achten, das der Treiber richtig herum montiert wird, die Pinmarkierung EN muss oben links liegen !!!!
Mir ist der erste TMC als auch der Arduino beim ersten Versuch abgeraucht, weil ich gepennt habe !!!!

Da Thingiverse zwingend noch eine STL Datei möchte, habe ich den Libellenhalter angehängt, diesen habe ich bei meinen Eggbot zum justieren der Stifte auf den oberen Stiftarm aufgeklebt.
Beschreibung : https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4704134


Now that the Eggbot is running, I found that the ""print"" is pretty shaky.
The first assumption was that the mechanism ""oscillates"".
Upon closer examination, the motor drivers came into consideration.
So solution sought and found.
The Trinamic TMC2208 drivers are compatible with the 4988 Pololu drivers.
These interpolate the steps to 256 steps and can be used after a small modification
exchanged for the 4988.
All you have to do is cut three pins on the TMC and set the current to the motor.
I adjusted the current/voltage on the potentiometer to 0.6 volts, so the steppers run quietly and quietly.
When printing, only the servo can be heard!
In addition, the print image is significantly improved, and there is hardly any trembling on the pen.
In the pictures you can see two eggs in comparison, left printed with TMC2208 and right printed with the old 4988 drivers.
The TMC 2208 is available from different manufacturers and in various variants.
I have the TMC from Bigtreetech in V 3.0 with potentiometer! taken.
There is also a variant without a potentiometer, which is not suitable.
As can be seen in the pictures, the three protruding pins on the underside of the driver are cut off here.
That was all of the modification apart from setting the voltage on the pot to about 0.6 volts.
Nothing needs to be changed in the software or on the board.

Danger !!! When installing the driver, make sure that the driver is installed in the correct direction, the pin marking EN must be on the top left !!!!
I lost the first TMC and the Arduino on the first try because I slept !!!!

Since Thingiverse absolutely wants an STL file, I attached the dragonfly holder, which I glued to the upper pin arm of my Eggbot to adjust the pins.

An infinite number of combinations of robots can be built from the available cube and cuboid blocks. Due to the plug-in system, the blocks can be connected without much effort and can form a wide variety of robot types. With the help of sensor and actuator attachments, which can be attached to the blocks with the same system, robots can be specialised for different tasks. The actuators include 360° Sevos and DC motors. Previously usable sensor technology consists of ultrasonic, light, colour and tactile sensors. Other attachments allow the connection of sensors and actuators with other electronic components such as breadboards, H-bridges, power sources and circuit boards that can be programmed like a microcontroller. Once a robot has completed its task, it can be disassembled into its individual parts and a completely new robot can be created. The Morph3dbot system is particularly suitable for use as an introduction to computer science and robotics for pupils, as the modularity of the actuators and sensors, as well as the programming that has to be done specifically, results in many tasks that require knowledge from beginners to advanced to experts. The free construction of the robots allows a high degree of creativity on the part of the students.

The main one is the use of a screwed-in servo retainer. This vastly reduces layer splitting from the servo and allows the servo to be installed with just screws and blue tac. With just this modification and Lego wheels, it is likely at the maximum weight or 2 grams over.

The 1mm thick top plate cuts about 2 grams. There is also a DXF if you want to get them cut.

The wider wedge should work better. It weighs about 50% more. The width should make it easier to push other bots and provides a wider surface to reduce the chance of a horizontal catching the edge. The downside is that the wedge is more likely to be ripped off by a horizontal.

The new flipper arm cuts about 5 grams. It won't provide as good of protection from overhead saws. The weight savings should allow adding a self-righting stick to be added. I haven't figured that part out yet. The mounting point has been beefed up a little as I had a layer splitting issue. The inside parts have been cut away in areas and beefed up in others to increase the non-binding movement range.

I am getting minor interference between the wedge and flipper, but it looks sandable. Use M3 x 12 button head screws for the flipper pivots. Use #3 plastite screws for the top, power switch, and servo retainer.

The wheels are the biggest pain with this thing. The bore wears out after a few insertions. I recommend using nylon and supergluing the wheel to the motor. I really need to buy some of those slot car wheels.

Es una variante del famoso robot de la serie Futurama, Bender Doblador Rodríguez.

**Proceso de diseño:**

Antes de empezar a diseñar el robot DYOR con TinkerCAD, lo primero fue pensar en un diseño original del mismo.

Una de las cosas que más me llamó la atención del modelo fue la pantalla de LEDs que hace las veces de boca del robot. Al pensar en robots que conocía a los que pudiera adaptar ese componente rápidamente me vino a la cabeza el robot de la serie Futurama, Bender.

Además, el sensor de ultrasonidos también se adapta bastante bien a la forma de los ojos del robot así que he adaptado ligeramente su forma para que sea parecido al original.

Por otro lado, las manos que lleva el modelo son simplemente decorativas ya que con las piezas de Lego que irán conectadas a los servos podré hacer los verdaderos brazos extensores de Bender, al añadir o quitar más piezas de Lego.

El diseño de las piezas está pensado para que el cuerpo de Bender encaje en la base a través de la ranura que esta tiene. Si hubiera holguras, la idea es pegar una pieza a la otra con pegamento o silicona caliente.

**Diseños TinkerCAD:**

* **Bender DYOR:** simplemente es un diseño para visualizar cómo sería el robot y dónde iría cada componente electrónico. Destacar que el zumbador está colocado detrás del cuerpo de Bender ya que el robot original no tiene nariz.

* **Base Bender:** si el tamaño de la cama de la impresora no es suficientemente grande como para imprimir ambas piezas juntas, se puede utilizar este archivo para imprimir solo esta pieza (85 x 150).

* **Cuerpo Bender:** exactamente lo mismo que en el caso anterior. Si el tamaño de la cama de la impresora no es suficientemente grande como para imprimir ambas piezas juntas, se puede utilizar este archivo para imprimir solo esta pieza (147 x 156).

* **Base y cuerpo juntos:** si la impresora tiene una cama lo suficientemente grande como para imprimir ambas piezas juntas (258 x 156), se puede utilizar este archivo.

El tamaño extra del cuerpo de Bender se debe al diseño de la antena y los brazos pero no deberían suponer ningún problema a la hora de realizar el montaje y en el funcionamiento del robot.

I designed this gear to be easily 3D-printable by making one side of the gear completely flat to avoid any issues with supports and making all holes 0.32 mm larger to account for thermal expansion of PLA material. Square holes are 0.32 mm larger in sidelength, and circular holes are 0.32 mm larger in diameter. The end result is a gear that has comfortable tolerances and is easy to slide a shaft or a connector pin into.

This is designed to be used with a standard servo. The servo is installed into the motor mount and spool is used  to spin wire cables to close the claw, springs are installed to open the claw when the servo spins to open position. Note adjustment screws on spool allow adjusting tension on each claw separately, similar to adjusting guitar strings. Once set epoxy in place, I also place epoxy on wire going into spool hole. Designed for FTC legal servo. Stainless steel cable is used and standard cable crimp sleeves. I used AHANDMAKER 304 Stainless Steel Wire Cable with aluminum crimp sleeve from Amazon.

https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B08NCWKV87/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1

Crimps are used at each end of cable for each claw. Screws are adjust and match tension on all four fingers of gripper which was difficult to do with original reference design. Crimps hold tension better than screws of original reference design. Note spool has Gobilda servo horn designed in, so this needs a Gobilda servo or one with similar 25 tooth spline (calibrated printer required to get accurate fit). There is also a spool with no servo horn that allows a servo horn to be mounted. Note that I epoxy the adjustment screws once set to prevent loosening. I use metal wire as the claw hinge threaded through and bent over. See photo. Coat hanger wire works great. File so no sharp edges hit mat, I epoxy over the wire to the mounting block so there no sharp edges to catch mat. Springs are placed in the two larger holes on the claw and the servo mount housing to open the claw. The claw itself has a built in stop that will limit the opening angle, this helps with adjusting the steel cable length with teh adjustment screws so that they close equally.  The springs are used are from Amazon, CREEYA Compression Springs Assortment Kit:

Updates:  
2014/08/17:  
Make the motor shaft hole render with a flat portion rather than fully cylindrical. This helps spread some of the load across the entire shaft rather than being fully reliant on the setscrew and the joint between the wheel and collar.","1. Measure your wheel dimensions, motor shaft dimensions, and choose a nut/setscrew size.  
2. Make sure the settings at the top of the .scad file are correct  
3. Export the .stl and slice. (20% density with honeycomb infill seems good enough.) My extrusion width is 0.6mm, and my layer height is 0.1mm. No support material is needed.  
4. Push a nut into the nut-trap in the collar  
5. Fit the collar into the motor shaft, align the screw hole with the flat portion of the motor shaft if there is one.  
6. Secure it with either a normal (default is M3) screw or setscrew.  
7. Fit the wheel onto the coupling  
8. Screw the printed M12 nut onto the threaded portion of the coupling (which should stick out of the wheel). It may be a bit hard to screw in at first, but what I found was that repeatedly easing it in and unscrewing it wore down the threads enough that you can screw it in with ease.","['coupler', 'coupling']",2,540,1351,0,0,0,Hobby,robotics,

http://www.gofundme.com/prosthetic-hand  

I'm working on a hybrid finger for Hollies Hand. This contains a finger connected with strong pin joints enclosed in an elastic 'skin'. The idea being that the skin acts as the returning force on the finger, allowing a single tendon to move the finger. Because the 'bones' are connected by pin joints they are tougher than if the entire design was made from a flexible material.  

I hope the final design will look like the original finger whilst providing a suitable gripping surface.  

The bone materials are SLS Nylon and the 'skin' is i.materialise rubber like material. I may also use silicone for the same purpose later.
