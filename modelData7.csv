The curved tracks that comes with the train have a 12 inches radius from the center of the track. I had a request from user ptgraham (https://www.thingiverse.com/ptgraham/designs) for a smaller radius. So here it is: 9 inches radius curves. With this you can make a 19 inches circle instead of 25. The picture shows the original and the new curve.

Please note it is a quick release. I did not had time to print several tracks to make a complete circle.

<b>Printing</b>
The tracks can be printed at 0.28mm height for faster print. The female connector has a 0.2mm brim to help bed adhesion. Support is needed to prevent lift off caused by the stretching when cooling.

I used PETG because it is best for snap fit things. PLA should be OK too but try it first with the test track. <b>Check the tips of the male connection after printing: </b> they should be rounded. If not trim them to avoid breaking the female connection.

(Not for commercial use)

This is a 1/153rd scale (largest I could make in the laser cutter!) Space Shuttle model assembled from laser cut flat parts. The model contains an Orbiter (you can etch decals onto the wings and vertical stabilizer), an External Tank, Solid Rocket Boosters, and a Base reminiscent of the Orbiter Service Masts. Everything fits together like a puzzle and just like a puzzle I have no assembly instructions. You can always refer to the .STL files for guidance!


Material:
Space Shuttle is 0.093 in. thick acrylic (about 2.36 mm)
Quantity -- I used 18 in. by 12 in sheets, I haven't optimize the provided sheets, but you will require about 8 sheets. (Might be able to make it with 6 or 7, did I mention I drew this 6 years ago?)

Base is               0.25 in. thick acrylic

Parts to cut:
Each sheet was setup for the laser cutter I was using. but the parts can be reorganized. Cut every part at least once on the following sheets, and keep the parts separate for ease of assembly.

1x Orbiter Sheet 1 v3 (I think I just added mounting parts with the version increments)
1x Orbiter Sheet 2

1x External Tank Sheet 1 (This is a corn cob)
1x External Tank Sheet 2

2x SRB Sheet 1 (watch out for the pointy bits)
2x SRB Sheet 2

1x Base Sheet 1 (There is only 1... add any dedication or the ""SPACE SHUTTLE 1/153rd Scale"" Text here to be like me!)

You should now have over one hundred parts. I think it is near 170 parts, not the worst puzzle.

Assembly:
Use non-fogging acrylic glue/cement
(I used CA glue, which is ok if you are fine with fogging.)
Parts should fit together with enough clearance to rattle. 
The shuttle wings serve as an integration plate.
External Tank has a top and bottom cap
SRB base has a cap, but top needs to be glued.
Hang Orbiter from 8th ring from top of the External Tank.
Rest 8th ring from top of external tank on 4th ring from top tab of SRBs.
Slide Orbiter into Base as a Unit.

Organisé par la FIA, il s'est déroulé en dix-sept manches entre le 29 mars 2009 et le 1er novembre 2009. Il est remporté par le Britannique Jenson Button chez les pilotes et par son écurie, Brawn GP Formula One Team, chez les constructeurs. 
Honda Racing F1 Team se retire brutalement de la compétition à la fin 2008 alors même qu'un budget important a été consacré au développement de la monoplace destinée à disputer la saison 2009. Ross Brawn, directeur technique de Honda et plusieurs de ses collègues rachètent l'écurie et l'enregistrent au championnat sous le nom de Brawn GP Formula One Team avec comme pilotes Jenson Button et Rubens Barrichello et un moteur Mercedes. La BGP 001 (qui devait initialement s'appeler Honda RA109), dotée de plusieurs solutions techniques innovantes dont un double diffuseur, se révèle rapidement particulièrement performante et bien adaptée à la nouvelle réglementation technique qui comprend notamment le retour aux pneus lisses. 
Jenson Button s'impose dès le premier Grand Prix de la saison, à Melbourne et, sur sa lancée, obtient quatre pole positions, six victoires, neuf podiums en se classant seize fois dans les points. Le pilote britannique est ainsi sacré champion du monde lors de l'avant-dernière course de la saison, au Brésil en se mettant hors de portée de ses derniers rivaux, son coéquipier Rubens Barrichello et le jeune Sebastian Vettel. 
Pour sa première année chez Red Bull Racing, Sebastian Vettel termine vice-champion du monde, à onze points de Button, et obtient quatre victoires. Son coéquipier Mark Webber remporte pour sa part deux courses ; ce sont les six premières victoires de l'écurie, emmenée par le directeur technique Adrian Newey, concepteur de la RB5-Renault. 
Brawn GP, championne du monde des constructeurs pour son unique saison de Formule 1, est rachetée par Mercedes-Benz et rebaptisée Mercedes Grand Prix, dont Ross Brawn va rester le directeur.

IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE SUPPORTS ON OR THIS BOAT WON'T WORK. THE WAY IT FLOATS IS BY FILLING THE BOAT WITH SUPPORTS WHICH MAKES IT LIGHTWIEGHT!  



This model is a model of a speedboat. The reason I made it was because I am graduating high school, and I row boats for my school, and I wanted to get my coach something cool. He knows that I am ""nerdy"" and he loves boats so I designed and printed him this. I will most likely answer your comments in 1-2 days!   

My print came out very fragile so you may want to increase the density. It is also very light and floats well. As you can see in the picture, it can hold up 3 pennies. Any more than that and it flips :)
